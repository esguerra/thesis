\section{Canonical and Noncanonical Base-pairs} 
As  seen   in  Figure   \ref{fig:saenger28},  there  can   be  various
base-pairing patterns between heterocyclic  bases in nucleic acids due
to the  variety of possible  hydrogen bonding interactions.   The most
prevalent   hydrogen   bonding   pattern   is   known   as   canonical
Watson-Crick. All  other possible patterns are  known as non-canonical
base-pairs and  are more common  in RNA than  in DNA.  We use  3DNA to
find  all base-pairs  in a  non-redundant database  of  RNA structures
obtained by X-ray crystallography with resolution better than 3.5 \AA,
which has  been obtained  from the nucleic  acids database  (NDB).  We
also constrained our  search to helical regions in  RNA.  Such helical
regions are  composed of  3 consecutive base-pairs  or more,  and they
need not be covalently  bonded by the sugar-phosphate backbone between
consecutive  base-pairs.  For more  details the  reader is  refered to
Olson et al. \cite{olson2009}.



In the helical regions data we quantify:

Abundances (Counts)
Deformabilites
Helical Context



NON-REDUNDANT DATABASE AND CONSTRAIN TO HELICAL REGIONS.

We use a non-redundant dataset of RNA structures.  By non-redundant we
mean to say  that, for the main source  of RNA structural information,
which is  the ribosome, we used  only one of  the available structures
per   organism,  that   is,   one  for   each  of   \textit{Deinococus
  Radiodurans},  \textit{Haloarcula  marismortui},  \textit{Escherichi
  coli},  and  \textit{Thermus thermophilus}.
