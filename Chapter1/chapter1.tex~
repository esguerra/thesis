\section{RNA folding}
The first  high resolution  X-ray\index{X-ray} structure of  RNA larger
than a dinucleotide was  that of yeast tRNA$^{\textrm{Phe}}$ at 3{\AA}
in 1974 \cite{robertus1974, kim1974}. Thirty years later there are two
orders    of    magnitude     more    RNA    structural    information
\cite{noller2005}, and new information is expected
\cite{weinberg2009}.   This  fact   and  the   discovery   of  ribozymes
\cite{kruger1982, takada1983} has renewed  interest in solving the RNA
folding\index{RNA  folding} problem, that  is, from  primary sequence,
finding in  an automated\footnote{The term  automated is used  here to
  mean  a  theoretical model  of  tertiary  folding,  which could  use
  experimental measures of secondary structure association in the same
  way   that  the  traditional   secondary  structure   folding  model
  \cite{zuker1989,    hofacker1994}    uses    the    Tinoco-Uhlenbeck
  dinucleotide   postulate  \cite{borer1974}   to   find  total   free
  energies.} way the native three-dimensional structure of RNA and its
folding pathway. The RNA folding\index{RNA folding} problem is usually
seen  as analogous to  the protein  folding problem,  due both  to the
discovery   of  the  enzymatic   behavior  of   RNA  \cite{kruger1982,
  takada1983}  and  the complicated  folding  of  large RNA  molecules
\cite{batey1999}.  To  take  advantage  of  this  analogy,  a  unified
conceptual framework  for describing  RNA and protein  folding, called
the  kinetic  partitioning  mechanism  (KPM), has  been  developed  by
Thirumalai and Hyeon \cite{thirumalai2005}. This and other methods are
based on  defining an adequate  partition function for  describing the
correct  conformational  ensemble  of  folded, partially  folded,  and
unfolded  structures   \cite{chen1995,  chen1998,  thirumalai1996}  of
either protein or RNA.

\section{Is RNA folding a hard or easy problem?}
There are two trains of thought regarding RNA folding. One states
that RNA folding is less complex than protein folding
\cite{tinoco1999} because RNA is made up of a four letter alphabet
of similar nucleotide units instead of a 20 letter alphabet of
dissimilar amino acids. Therefore the number of possible sequential
combinations is smaller. It is also known that secondary and
tertiary interactions can be separated in the case of RNA by the
absence or presence of Mg$^{2+}$ \cite{rangan2003} (see Figure 1.1),
whereas secondary and tertiary elements are not as easily separable in proteins.

\caption{Separation of secondary and tertiary interaction in
RNA \cite{rangan2003}. Double helical secondary structure
represented  by individual cylinders and tertiary interactions by
association of cylinders.}
\end{figure}
The other point of view says that RNA folding can be at least as
complex as protein folding \cite{moore1999a, sorin2004} since there
is no such thing as hydrophobic burial of regions of RNA as in the
case of proteins. Instead, the electrostatic problem of having a
complex charged backbone must be dealt with in the case of RNA.
% The case of the electrostatic treatment of the backbone is lacking
% here, most likely WKO wants me not to ignore our own Gerald Manning
% tinoco 1999 says this must be an easy to solve problem since we can do
% the electrostatics for it easily
For instance, the interactions of the RNA polyanionic backbone with
water and cations \cite{klein2004a} are not easily simulated with
explicit solvent models as can be done for proteins. The
aforementioned interactions of RNA need to be modeled implicitly, and
must aim to describe long dynamic processes of the order of seconds
to minutes, in contrast to the typical time scales of tens of
microseconds associated with protein folding.
% Remember that this means that a explicit calculation for RNA would be prohibitively large.
Although secondary and tertiary structure can be separated
experimentally, there have been few theoretical efforts to account
for the folding of RNA from a random sequence of nucleotides into
secondary structures and tertiary structures. What little is know
has been investigated at low resolution. Professor Stephen Harvey
and associates have simulated yeast tRNA$^{\textrm{Phe}}$
\cite{malhotra1990, stagg2003} at various levels of detail, initially using
only one pseudoatom per helical region, and later one pseudoatom per
nucleotide.
%Note for presentation ==> Include figure 1 in Malhotra-harvey paper
%Look at what says in folding.stanford.edu/science.html Also take
%into account Biophys J. V.88 2516-2524 for the case of having to
%think of water in the folding problem.
By contrast, in the case of proteins many groups have simulated the
transition from secondary to tertiary structure, including some
calculations which account for the strong coupling of secondary and
tertiary structure \cite{westhead1999, gerstein2003, meiler2003}.
This type of work is often referred to as protein structural
topology and there is no counterpart for RNA.

%The seminal paper here seems to be the one of liphardt in 2001 for rna unfolding
\section{Experimental folding techniques}
Traditionally RNA folding and unfolding have been followed
calorimetrically and spectroscopically as a function of temperature
and cation concentration \cite{bloomfield2000}. While this approach
works well for studying two-state folders, \textit{i.e.}, structures which
populate only two states (native and melted), in general RNA's are
not two-state folders. RNA seems to go through a rugged free energy
landscape of conformations in the process of folding
\cite{zhuang2003}. The experimental solution to this problem is
offered by single molecule techniques like fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) and mechanical micromanipulation, in which
the ends of RNA are attached to micron sized beads which are then
pulled apart and monitored with a laser light trap
\cite{liphardt2001, onoa2004, tinoco2004, hyeon2005}. In the case of
single molecule force-induced unfolding, state transitions often occur under
non-equilibrium conditions, thereby making it difficult to extract
equilibrium information from the data. Recently Bustamante, Tinoco,
and associates have shown that using the Crooks fluctuation theorem
\cite{crooks1999}, one can deal with such cases and extract RNA
folding free energies from single molecule experiments
\cite{collin2005}.

% It still is to be seen whether the following is relevant or not
% This single molecule information is
% collected in-vitro and not in-vivo, which is actually the ultimate
% problem aimed for prediction, there's quite a lot of evidence for
% different folding states reached in one case and not the other and
% viceversa \cite{sosnick2003, schroeder2002} but still a first step
% towards understanding in-vivo folding is in-vitro and in-silico
% experimentation.

\section{RNA simulations}
Network and molecular mechanics-molecular dynamics (MM-MD) methods
provide useful information relevant to the RNA folding-unfolding
problem, especially for describing fluctuations away from the native
conformation. Gaussian network models \cite{y_wang2004, bahar1998,
wang2005} which treat RNA at less than atomic detail have been used
to describe the motions of large RNA structures like the ribosome.
Examples of the predicted normal modes of motion of the ribosome can
be seen at: http://ribosome.bb.iastate.edu/70SnK mode. Using MM,
Sanbonmatsu and coworkers obtained a static atomic model of the 70S
ribosome structure through homology modeling \cite{tung2004}. Tung and
associates used this structure for an all-atom MD simulation of the
movement of tRNA into a fluctuating ribosome \cite{sanbonmatsu2005}.
This type of simulation might be useful in a reverse-folding
approach to the RNA folding problem. To the best of my knowledge,
such calculations haven't as yet been done for RNA.

\section{Local nucleotide interactions}
%\subsubsection{QM approaches and MM consequences}
The molecular interactions which rule RNA structures at the nucleic
acid base level, \textit{i.e.}, local level, are hydrogen bonding and
stacking interactions. The former are related to base pairing and
the latter, in most cases, to nucleotide steps. These interactions
can be explored theoretically at various levels. At the highest
level are ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations which are still
too expensive for systems as large as hundreds of atoms. Such
calculations, nevertheless, can tell a great deal about local
electronic behavior. For example, Hobza and collaborators have found
that the stacking interaction of free nucleotide bases is determined
by dispersion attraction, short-range exchange repulsion, and electrostatic
interaction. No specific $\pi-\pi$ interactions are found from
electron correlated ab-initio calculations \cite{sponer1996,
sponer1997}. This is why force field methods have been so successful
in the study of nucleic acids, since the empirical potentials used
in such studies mimic well the quantum mechanically obtained energy
profiles \cite{tung2004, sponer2000}.
% since they can be
%modeled easily with simple empirical potentials consisting of
%Lennard-Jones, van der Waals and Coulomb terms.
% What the recent results say it's simply that by using a larger
% basis set, they can account for some interactions which were not included
% before, and maybe because of taking better account of electron-correlation.
A currently debated ab-initio finding is whether small fluctuations
in the configurations of neighboring base pairs (dimers) are
iso-energetic or not. Recent calculations of Sponer and Hobza
\cite{sponer2006} seem to contradict their older publications
\cite{sponer2000, hobza2002}, in which the stacking energies were
reported to be relatively insensitive to dimer conformation. The new
results use the so-called ``coupled cluster singles doubles with triple electron
excitations'' CCSD(T) method, to account for electron correlation.
Using this electron correlation energy correction, the stacking
energy differences between dimer conformations turn out to be
considerably higher than previously reported.

%, therefore justifying rigid body parameter interpretations.
%\subsubsection{Experimental Stacking and Polyionic backbone}
Single and double strand stacking free energies can be obtained
calorimetrically. The most popular method used for obtaining such
quantities is differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
\cite{marky1982}. These measurements show favorable dinucleotide
stacking free energies as large as -3.6 kcal/mol for double strand
stacking. Experimentally, the magnitudes of these interactions are
found to be sequence dependent \cite{bloomfield2000}. In fact, the
stacking free energies for some sequences\footnote{Unpaired terminal
 nucleotides UC/A  UU/A  at 1M NaCl.} are found to be negligible. Thus
there may be no accountable stacking interaction at all for some sequences.

Besides taking into account the effects of stacking and hydrogen
bonding, it is important to think at the same time about the
polyelectrolyte nature of the RNA backbone. Manning's counterion
condensation theory \cite{manning1977, manning2003} provides a
simple and quantitative picture of the interactions of the double
helical nucleic acid polyanion with its counterions, although it
does not take into account the discrete nature of charge
\cite{bloomfield2000} or the folding of RNA. Poisson-Boltzmann
theory offers a more detailed picture of the behavior of charged
macroions in solution \cite{antypov2005}.
%but does not address the discrete charge problem.
%Talk more about counterion condensation, thirumalai discusses it on
%his 2001 paper also chapter 8 of Bloomfield, Crothers, Tinoco
%(References \cite{manning2003} Ray-Manning?).
%Real Experiments results for stacking energies and polyanion energies and
%Energetics related to cation metal presence
%WKO says that there might be old experimental data that are contrary
%to this and that I must show it here, so far what I've found is
%Saenger saying that based on old QC and this is different, he
%relates it to hydrophobicity concepts. Talk about experiments.

The local conformational space of RNA has been studied using a large
set of available RNA structures from the Nucleic Acid Database
(NDB) \cite{berman1992}. The torsion angles of the nucleotide steps have been
clustered in the parameter space using different techniques
\cite{murray2003, schneider2004}. The root-mean-square deviations
(RMSD) of the distances between closely spaced atoms in the
phosphates, sugars, and bases, have also been clustered
\cite{sykes2005}. The latter studies are aimed at finding the common
nucleotide base steps and base-pair building blocks which are given
the name of RNA doublets.

\section{RNA secondary structure algorithms and the lack of tertiary ones}
From secondary structure prediction algorithms like Zuker's
\textit{mfold} program \cite{zuker2003}, or Hofacker's Vienna RNA
package \cite{hofacker1994}, one obtains a large ensemble of
secondary structure graphs. These graphs can be analyzed with graph
theory to produce a partition function describing a full arrangement
of contacts for the total number of possible secondary structures
\cite{chen2000}. So far this type of model has not been generalized
to take into account tertiary structural features, \textit{i.e.},
interhelical interactions of RNA.

\section{RNA overall fold}
Whereas in the case of proteins one can describe the overall fold
from the arrangement of secondary structure motifs, \textit{i.e.}, using the
helix-ribbon-coil images developed by Jane Richardson
\cite{richardson2000} (see Figure 1.2), there is still no comparable
description of the overall fold of RNA. A ribbon
representation of the sugar phosphate backbone helps to understand the
folding of small RNA's, but in the case of the ribosome this type of 
representation is not sufficient, see Figure 1.3.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Chapter1/overallfold.png}

  intermolecular units of a dimer of prealbumin, or

\caption{\textit{Haloharcula marismortui's} large ribosomal subunit
(left) and hammerhead ribozyme (right).%NDBID:UR0029
 The figures were taken
directly from the NDB web pages, and show a ribbon
representation of the phosphate backbone, and a block representation
for the nucleotide bases. From the figures it's clear that, whereas the
ribozyme fold can be clearly understood with this representation, the
ribosome fold cannot.}
\end{figure}
%So far the Richardson's group
%has developed a graphical way to visualize interhelical interactions in
%ribosomal regions like the interaction of the 5S ribosomal subunit
%with helix 38 of 23S domain II
%using KING software (see Figure 1.3) to
%represent what they call contact dots. That is, they are showing the 
%interaction on A minor motif
%
One can envision that a
thorough investigation of the parameter space of translational and
rotational degrees of freedom of the helical regions of RNA could
give clues as to how we might see an overall fold in RNA structures.

In the case of proteins the SCOP (Structural Classification of
Proteins) database \cite{andreeva2004}, classifies proteins, among
other classifications, according to recurrent arrangements of
secondary structure, that is, folds. The SCOR (Structural
Classification of RNA) database \cite{klosterman2002,
klosterman2004}, aims to provide a similar classification to that
obtained for proteins, but using RNA motifs\footnote{Leontis and
Westhof \cite{leontis2003} define RNA motifs as: "Directed and
ordered arrays of non-WC (Watson-Crick) base-pairs forming
distinctive foldings of the phosphodiester backbones of the
interacting RNA strands"} instead. This classification focuses on the
local folding of small pieces of RNA and cannot
describe the overall fold.
