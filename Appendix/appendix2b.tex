\section{Principal Component Analysis}
Given  a set  of data  it's important  to check  before analysis  if the
dimensions of such  set can be reduced. A very  common method to check
this is called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The PCA  method can be defined  in a strictly mathematical way as the
method which; finds the Principal  Components (PCs) of  a dataset by
doing  "an orthogonal  linear  transformation of  a  set of  variables
optimizing certain algebraic criterion" \cite{jolliffe2002}.

  \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{T}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}
