Nucleic  Acids and  other  polymers can  be  understood as  mechanical
objects   \cite{marko2003,  nelson2004}   and   therefore  engineering
approaches can  be used for their understanding.   Usually the methods
followed by  the engineering approach  consider the polymer as  a long
continuous rod, and  are known as continuum elastic  theory. This type
of approach leaves little space  for taking into account the nature of
the  subunits  which  make up  the  polymer,  that  is, it  is  mainly
applicable to  homopolymers made up of identical  subunits. In nucleic
acids this is not necesarily  the case, a more general approach should
take into account the  possibility of having different subunits making
up  the polymer.  Olson  and collaborators  have developed  a sequence
dependent model, refered to as the "realistic" model \cite{olson1993}.
Such model is harmonic  and depends on determination of force-constant
analogs  derived  from  X-Ray  cristallographic data  taken  from  the
Nucleic  Acid  Database  (NDB)  \cite{go1976, olson1998}.  Within  the
context of the "realistic" model Czapla et al.  \cite{czapla2006} have
suggested   a   gaussian  sampling   methodology   which  allows   the
determination of global polymer properties like the persistence length
$a$ following  a matrix  approach suggested by  Flory \cite{flory1969}
and expanded upon by Olson et al. \cite{maroun1998, marky1994}

In what follows we summarize various definitions of persistence length
and how it's computed using different models.
%The "realistic model" can be simplified to other  models, for example
%to the  freely rotating model, just by  making the  twisting constant
%zero, that is, the polymer will not be elastic when twisted.
\section{Persistence Lenght Definitions}
There are two parallel perspectives  which can be used to define the
persistence length of  nucleic acids.  One is a  more mathematical, or
physical one, where it is  understood as the resistence to deformation
of a curve in space, or thin rod, a physical object.  The other one is a
stochastic one  where it is understood  as "a measure  of the distance
over which  the direction of  the DNA is  maintained \cite{olson1995}"
and  has the  classical formulation  by  Flory which  states that  the
persistence length is:

"the average sum of the projections of all bonds $ j \geq i$  on bond
$i$ in an indefinetely long chain. The bond $i$ is taken to be remote
from either end of the chain, i.e., $1 \ll i \ll n$". Paul J. Flory,
Statistical Mechanics of Chain Molecules. 1969

This perspective has a more chemically flavored tone, since it assumes
some type of bonded  connectivity between polymeric units, whether the
bond is a "real" one, or a "virtual" one.

``\textbf{Bend-persistence length}:\\ 
A length scale beyond which the elastic cost of bending is totally
negligible'' Philip Nelson, Yearbook of Science and Technology, McGraw
Hill 1999

``In a randomly shaken rod any particular point in the rod will be
pointing in a random direction, but nearby points will be pointing in
roughly the same direction, that is, these nearby points are
persistent. Points farther away than the bend-persistence length are
said to be uncorrelated.'' Philip Nelson, Yearbook of Science and
Technology, McGraw Hill 1999

``\textbf{twist-persistence length}:\\
that is, a rubber rod not only resists bending but also twisting''

"basic mechanical property that quantifies stiffness"
Abels et al, Biophysical Journal, 2005, 2737-2744


"Classical elasticity tells us that a thin, straight rod that is bent
into an arc has a bending energy $E=Bl/2R^2$, where $B$ is the bending
elastic constant of the rod, $l$ is the length of the rod and $R$ is
the radius of arc. Setting $R=l$ gives us the energy of a 1 radian
bend along the rod, and solving for when $E \kappa_{B}T$ gives us the
length of rod along which a thermally excited bend of 1 radian
typically occurs: $l B/\kappa_{B}T$. This is called the persistence
length..." John F. Marko and Simona Cocco, Physics World, March 2003



\begin{gather}
E=\frac{Bl}{2R^2}\\
R=l\\
E \sim k_{B}T\\
l \sim \frac{B}{k_{B}T}
\end{gather}  




"The persistence length $a$ is a measure of the stiffness of a polymer
chain and is related to the limiting value of the characteristic ratio
at infinite chain length
\begin{gather}
a=\frac{\nu}{2}(C_{\infty}+1)
\end{gather}
"

"length at which the orientation of the sequential bonds which make
up a polymer chain, stop being correlated. That is, if you have just
two bonds, or a few, they will be correlated, which is the case in most
molecules, but, in polymers, you have a long chain of sequential
bonds. At some length, bonds will become uncorrelated, but up to that
length they were correlated, this is what is meant by persistence
length, and, in this context it's obvious that is an exclusive
property of polymers." My understanding so far.


Biopolymers can be either rigid or flexible. 

They can be classified  according to whether their persistence length ($a$)
is greater, smaller, or similar to the contour length ($L$) of the polymer.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\hline
Model Type      & Polymer Characteristic & $a$ to $L$ relation\\ \hline
Rigid Rod       & Rigid          &        $a \gg L$   \\
Gaussian chain  & Flexible       &        $a \ll L$   \\
Worm-like chain & Semi-flexible  &    $a \approx L$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
Notice that for $a \gg L$, there is a definition problem, since $L$
has to be large enough to be a good approximation to the definition of
persistence length, which is defined for an infinite chain length.

If the persistence length is of the same order of the length of the
polymer, then the polymer is classified as  semi-flexible

\begin{center}

\hline
Polymer       & $a$ (nm)   \\ \hline
$\alpha$-helix & 80-100\\
coiled-coil & 150-300\\
Ideal DNA  &  51  \\
Ideal RNA & 70-80 \\
\hline

Think about the "energy" based perspective of Nicolas, and the
stochastic based perspective of Flory and others.

\section{end-to-end}
The end-to-end vector  $r$ is the vector which connects  the ends of a 
polymer chain.  It  can be defined  as the sum  of the vectors connecting the
monomer units in a chain. These connecting vectors are sometimes called
virtual  bond vectors $l$.  

From  the end-to-end  vector  the quantity
which is usually of interest is it's magnitude.

\begin{gather}
\label{eq:end2end}
r = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}\\
r^2 = r \cdot r = \sum_{i,j}l_{i} \cdot l_{j}
\end{gather}
Equation \ref{eq:end2end}, can also be written:
\begin{gather}
r^2 = \sum_{i}l_{i}^{2} + 2 \sum_{i\neq j} l_{i} \cdot l_{j}
\end{gather}  

To  describe a  polymer  it's  necessary to  think  about the  various
conformations it can adopt  due to its flexibility, therefore, it
is important  to think of polymer  related quantities in  terms of the
average of their possible conformations. For the end-to-end vector the
average of  its values  is denoted  as $<r>$, and  the average  of its
norm, also called the second moment of the end-to-end distribution, is
denoted by $<r^2>$:
\begin{gather}
\label{eq:secmom}  
<r^2>=\sum_{i}<l_{i}^2> + 2\sum_{i<j}<l_{i} \cdot l_{j}>
\end{gather}  

When there is no correlation between succesive bonds we can write:

\begin{gather}
\label{eq:nocorr}
<l_{i} \cdot l_{j}> = 0
\end{gather}

So that equation \ref{eq:secmom} keeps only the bond auto-correlation term:

\begin{gather}
<r^2> = \sum_{i}<l_{i}^2> = n<l^2>
\end{gather}  

This equation is used to describe a so-called freely-jointed chain.





\section{Models}

Nelson in book says:

\begin{gather}
dE=\frac{1}{2} K_{B}T [A\beta^2+Bu^2+C\omega^2+2Du\omega] ds
\end{gather}  

A$\kappa \beta$ T = Bend stiffness
B$\kappa \beta$ T = Stretch stiffness
C$\kappa \beta$ T = Twist stiffness
D$\kappa \beta$ T = Twist-stretch coupling

If only the bend stiffness survives then the model is called an
inextensible model, also Porod-Kratky, or WLC.
