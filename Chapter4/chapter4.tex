\section{Analysis (Albany Poster) and Django Webserver}
Results shown in Albany poster and steps part of methods paper.

After the work done for the methods paper we extract the force
constant matrices for the 10 unique canonical base-pair steps of RNA
and we use this results to determine the persistence length of RNA
using the sequence-dependent gaussian sampled model (the "realistic"
model) of Olson and collaborators.

\section{Persistence Length of RNA}
A quantity commonly used to  quantify the stiffness of polymers is the
so-called persistence  length $a$. To determine this  quantity for DNA
or RNA a variety of  theoretical and experimental techniques are used.
Some  common experimental  techniques  to determine  $a$ are  Electron
Microscopy   (EM),  gel  electrophoresis,   sedimentation  velocities,
electrical  birefringence,  atomic force  microscopy  (AFM) ,  magnetic
tweezers,  and small angle  X-Ray scattering  (SAXS).  For  reviews of
such  techniques  applied  to  the determination  of  RNA  persistence
length, we refer the  reader to Hagerman \cite{hagerman1997}, Abels et
al.  \cite{abels2005},  and Caliskan et  al.  \cite{caliskan2005}.  We
will  use their  results for  comparison  with those  coming from  the
"realistic"    model   developed    by    Olson   and    collaborators
\cite{olson1995} to  describe DNA. The "realistic"  model is dependent
on  high resolution  crystallographic data.   Initial  studies started
with small numbers  of data for the deformabilities  of the ten unique
base-pair steps  \cite{olson1995}. A more complete  picture applied to
the study of DNA  sequence dependent deformability became available in
1998 \cite{olson1998}.  The base-pair  step deformability data for DNA
has  been   constantly  refined  as  more  high   resolution  DNA  and
DNA-protein  structures have been  added to  the Nucleic  Acid Database
(NDB)  \cite{balasubramanian2009}.    Although  such  data   has  been
available for  DNA since 1998, such was not the case for  RNA, until now
\cite{olson2009}.

A detailed description of the  ``realistic'' model along with the scheme
of the C++  code developed by Czapla and Zheng to  implement it, and a
brief account of various  definitions of persistence length and models
from which $a$ can be derived are included in Appendix~\ref{appendix4a}
