%%% Abstract
\abstract{RNA structure is at the forefront of our understanding of
the beginning of life, also the mechanisms of life regulation and control.
The life regulation part is new, not ten years old.
Primodial in understanding the cell.
The practical purpuse for the chemist is to understand how RNA folds.
It's mainly a mechanical problem, therefore it's not foreing to use
statistical mechanics methods, combined with detailed knownledge of atomic
level structure.

\acknowledgements{I would first like to give a special thanks to
Dr. Yurong Xin, who's patience and help at the very beginning of my
joining of the Olson lab, have been fundamental for the development of
this thesis. I would like to thank Dr. Olson's extreme patience, and
room for freedom of carrying out "undirected research". Finally I
would to thank all colleagues at the Olson lab.}

many, many things in the world. But if I was contemplating the stove,
it was my world, and everything else colorless by contrast with it ...}
