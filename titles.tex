%%% Abstract
\abstract{RNA structure is at the forefront of our understanding of
the origin of life, the mechanisms of life regulation, and
control, and it plays a primordial role in viruses.
Our knowledge of the importance of RNA in life regulation is
relatively new, (a bit more than a decade, Craig and Mello, Nature
1998) and along with the detailed structural elucidation of the
transcription machine, the ribosome, have propelled interest in
RNA understanding to a level which starts to closely resemble that
given to proteins.
In these scheme of progressively understanding the landscape of
functionality of such a complex polymer as RNA, one practical task
left to the structural chemist is to understand the details of how
structure mandates large scale polymer processes, in this case it's
fundamental to understand how RNA folds, and which are the typical
conformations it assumes.
The RNA folding problem can be understood as a mechanical problem,
therefore it's not foreign to use statistical mechanical methods,
combined with detailed knowledge of atomic level structure. Such
methodology is mainly used in this work in a long term effort
on understanding the intrinsic structural features of RNA, and how
they might relate to it's folding.}

Dr. Yurong Xin, who's patience, help, and collaboration since the very
beginning of my joining of the Olson lab, have been fundamental for
the development of this work. I would like to thank Dr. Olson's
extreme patience, and room for freedom on carrying out this
