%%% Abstract
\abstract{RNA structure is in the forefront of our understanding of
the beginning of life, also the mechanisms in life regulation.
The life regulation part is new, not ten years old.
Primodial in understanding the cell.
The practical purpuse for the chemist is to understand how RNA folds.
It's mainly a mechanical problem, therefore it's not foreing to use
statistical mechanics methods, combined with detailed knownledge of atomic
level structure.

many, many things in the world. But if I was contemplating the stove,
it was my world, and everything else colorless by contrast with it ...}
