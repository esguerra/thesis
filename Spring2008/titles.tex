%%% Abstract
\abstract{This report carries over the Fall of 2007 report in its
first Chapter. It adds to it more data on clustering analysis of the
space of torsion angles, and base-step parameters for RNA
dinucleotide steps. It also
contains a Chapter with the results presented at the IMA Workshop in
Minnessota in 2007. 
The last Chapter has some initial tables and
figures on the analysis of an RNA Dataset put together by Dr. Yurong Xin}

%A review of the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) of
%Bahar and coworkers and how it could be reinterpreted using the
%standard reference frame derived base-step parameters. And the
%connections between GNM and chemical graph theory.}
