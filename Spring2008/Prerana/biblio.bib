  abstract = {One of the most common {RNA} tertiary interactions involves the docking
	of {GNRA} hairpin loops into stem-loop structures on other regions
	of {RNA}. {D}omain 5 of the group {II} intron interacts with {D}omain
	1 through such an interaction, which has been characterized thermodynamically
	and kinetically for the ai5g intron. {U}sing this system, it was
	possible to test the morphological tolerances of the {GNRA} tetraloop
	involved in tertiary interactions. {T}he data presented herein show
	that a {GNRA} tetraloop can still participate in tertiary interaction
	after being physically cut at any phosphodiester linkage within the
	loop. {T}he "nicked tetraloop" can be expanded by many nucleotides
	in either direction and the covalently continuous loop can also be
	expanded without loss of interaction energy. {I}n the context of
	the nicked tetraloop, the second nucleotide of the tetraloop sequence
	can be completely deleted without loss of function. {B}y examining
	radical alterations in tetraloop structure, this study helps define
	the minimal sequence and structural requirements of a {GNRA} motif
	involved in long-range tertiary interaction. {I}t shows that "tetraloop"-like
	structures capable of forming tertiary interactions can be imbedded
	in unexpected contexts, such as internal loops and apparently open
	structure within {RNA}. {I}t demonstrates that pentaloops and hexaloops
	can form the same type of interaction, with almost equal affinity,
	as a tetraloop. {T}aken together, these data suggest a more generic
	term for the {GNRA} tetraloop-receptor interaction: {I}t is proposed
	herein that the term "{GNRA} tetraloop" be replaced by "{GN}n/{RA}",
	where n represents a variable number of nucleotides and / indicates
	that the loop can be divided and interrupted by other sequences.},

	{T}his paper presents the concepts, mathematics, theorems, and proofs
	that form the basis of a new program to analyze three-dimensional
	{DNA} and {RNA} structures. {T}he approach taken here provides numerical
	data in accordance with guidelines set at a 1988 {EMBO} workshop.
	{M}athematical definitions are provided for all local structural
	parameters described in the guidelines. {T}he definitions satisfy
	the guideline requirements while preserving the original physical
	intuition of the parameters. {I}n particular, the rotational parameters
	are true rotations based on a simple physical model (net rotation
	at constant angular velocity), not {E}uler angles or angles between
	vectors and planes as is the case with other approaches. {A}s a result,
	the mathematical definitions are symmetrical with the property that
	a 5° tilt is the same as a 5° roll and a 5° twist, except that the
	rotations take place about different axes. {I}n other approaches,
	a 5° tilt can mean a different amount of net rotation than a 5° roll
	or a 5° twist. {A} second unique feature of the mathematics is that
	it explicitly incorporates the concept of a pivot point, which is
	the point about which a base in a base-pair rotates as it buckles,
	propeller twists, and opens. {P}ivot points enable one to model the
	physical motion of bases more accurately. {A}s a result, they greatly
	reduce and/or eliminate the statistical correlations between rotational
	and translational parameters that arise as mathematically induced
	artifacts in other approaches. {T}his paper, together with the statistical
	analysis in the companion paper for determining the locations of
	the pivot points, provides everything needed to understand the output
	of the program as it relates to individual structures.},

  journal = {Journal of {M}olecular {B}iology},
  year = {1998},
  volume = {281},
  pages = {871-884},
  abstract = {The vibrational dynamics of transfer {RNA}s, both free, and complexed
	with the cognate synthetase, are analyzed using a model ({G}aussian
	network model) which recently proved to satisfactorily describe the
	collective motions of folded proteins. {T}he approach is similar
	to a normal mode analysis, with the major simplification that no
	residue specificity is taken into consideration, which permits us
	(i) to cast the problem into an analytical form applicable to biomolecular
	systems including about 103residues, and (ii) to acquire information
	on the essential dynamics of such large systems within computational
	times at least two orders of magnitude shorter than conventional
	simulations. {O}n a local scale, the fluctuations calculated for
	yeast t{RNAP}he and t{RNAA}sp in the free state, and for t{RNAG}lncomplexed
	with glutaminyl-t{RNA} synthetase ({G}ln{RS}) are in good agreement
	with the corresponding crystallographic {B} factors. {O}n a global
	scale, a hinge-bending region comprising nucleotides {U}8 to {C}12
	in the {D} arm, {G}20 to {G}22 in the {D} loop, and m7{G}46 to {C}48
	in the variable loop (for t{RNAP}he), is identified in the free t{RNA},
	conforming with previous observations. {T}he two regions subject
	to the largest amplitude anticorrelated fluctuations in the free
	form, i.e. the anticodon region and the acceptor arm are, at the
	same time, the regions that experience the most severe suppression
	in their flexibilities upon binding to synthetase, suggesting that
	their sampling of the conformational space facilitates their recognition
	by the synthetase. {L}ikewise, examination of the global mode of
	motion of {G}ln{RS} in the complex indicates that residues 40 to
	45, 260 to 270, 306 to 314, 320 to 327 and 478 to 485, all of which
	cluster near the {ATP} binding site, form a hinge-bending region
	controlling the cooperative motion, and thereby the catalytic function,
	of the enzyme. {T}he distal {B}-barrel and the t{RNA} acceptor binding
	domain, on the other hand, are distinguished by their high mobilities
	in the global modes of motion, a feature typical of recognition sites,
	also observed for other proteins. {M}ost of the conserved bases and
	residues of t{RNA} and {G}ln{RS} are severely constrained in the
	global motions of the molecules, suggesting their having a role in
	stabilizing and modulating the global motion.},

	This method is based on the development of a reduced representation

	eight-dimensional problem that has long complicated nucleic acid
	conformational analysis. Two pseudotorsion angles (n and t) have
	been defined, based on the selection of two appropriate pivot points
	along the RNA backbone, P and C4'. These pseudotorsions, together
	with a complete library of conventional torsion angles, can be calculated
	for any RNA structure or all-atom model using a new program called
	AMIGOS. Having computed n and t pseudotorsions for each position
	on an RNA molecule, they can be represented on a two-dimensional
	plot similar to the p-phi plots that have traditionally been used
	for protein conformational analysis. Like a Ramachandran plot, clusters
	of residues appear at discrete regions on an n-t plot. Nucleotides
	within these clusters share conformational properties, often belonging
	to the same type of structural motif such as A-platforms, sheared
	tandem purine-purine pairs and GNRA tetraloops. An n-t plot provides
	a two-dimensional representation of the conformational properties
	of an entire RNA molecule, facilitating rapid analysis of structural
	features. In addition to the utility of n-t plots for intuitive visualization
	of conformational space, the pseudotorsional convention described

	two approaches described here involve torsion
	
	matching and binning. Torsion matching is a

	accurately by a limited number of discrete conformational
	
	states. We identify and eliminate extraneous

	information. That information is not signi®-
	
	cantly compromised by binning the continuous
	
	torsional information into a limited number of
	
	discrete values. The correspondence between
	
	torsion matching and binning is 99% (per residue).
	
	Binning, however, does have several advantages. In
	
	particular, we demonstrate that the conformation of
	
	a large complex RNA molecule can be represented
	
	by a small alphabet. In addition, the binning method

	one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering
	is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions

	generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents
	an overview of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern
	recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and
	references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community
	of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering

	By comparing ideal composite knots with simulated configurations

	knots and their corresponding factor knots. We show that composite
	knots with several factor knots may possess distinct structural isomers

	such as intrinsic curvature, are important to the packaging and processing
	of the genetic material. Here we investigate the internal dynamics
	of a 200 bp closed circular molecule with natural curvature using
	a newly developed normal-mode treatment of DNA in terms of neighboring
	base-pair "step" parameters. The intrinsic curvature of the DNA is
	described by a 10 bp repeating pattern of bending distortions at
	successive base-pair steps. We vary the degree of intrinsic curvature
	and the superhelical stress on the molecule and consider the normal-mode
	fluctuations of both the circle and the stable figure-8 configuration
	under conditions where the energies of the two states are similar.
	To extract the properties due solely to curvature, we ignore other
	important features of the double helix, such as the extensibility
	of the chain, the anisotropy of local bending, and the coupling of
	step parameters. We compare the computed normal modes of the curved
	DNA model with the corresponding dynamical features of a covalently
	closed duplex of the same chain length constructed from naturally
	straight DNA and with the theoretically predicted dynamical properties
	of a naturally circular, inextensible elastic rod, i.e., an O-ring.
	The cyclic molecules with intrinsic curvature are found to be more
	deformable under superhelical stress than rings formed from naturally
	straight DNA. As superhelical stress is accumulated in the DNA, the
	frequency, i.e., energy, of the dominant bending mode decreases in
	value, and if the imposed stress is sufficiently large, a global
	configurational rearrangement of the circle to the figure-8 form
	takes place. We combine energy minimization with normal-mode calculations
	of the two states to decipher the configurational pathway between
	the two states. We also describe and make use of a general analytical
	treatment of the thermal fluctuations of an elastic rod to characterize
	the motions of the minicircle as a whole from knowledge of the full
	set of normal modes. The remarkable agreement between computed and
	theoretically predicted values of the average deviation and dispersion
	of the writhe of the circular configuration adds to the reliability
	in the computational approach. Application of the new formalism to
	the computed modes of the figure-8 provides insights into macromolecular
	motions which are beyond the scope of current theoretical treatments.},

	distribution of the ribosomal proteins in the head, body and side

	16 S rRNA, fitted to the same EM contour (described in an accompanying
	paper), in order to analyse the mutual compatibility of the arrangement
	of proteins and rRNA in terms of the available RNA-protein interaction
	data. The information taken into account included the hydroxyl radical

	{T}he base stacking interactions show three degrees of freedom: slide-roll-twist,
	shift-tilt, and rise (which is more or less constant). {C}oupling
	is observed between the base and backbone degrees of freedom. {T}he
	major base stacking mode, slide-roll-twist, is coupled to the major
	backbone mode, -{P}--. {T}he secondary base stacking mode, shift-tilt,
	is coupled to and and to a lesser extent to the -{P}-- mode. {W}e
	show that the length of the backbone, {C}, given by the same strand
	{C}1?-{C}1? separation, is an excellent single parameter descriptor
	for the conformation of the backbone and the way in which it is coupled
	to the base stacking geometry. {T}he slide-roll-twist motion relates
	to changes in the mean backbone length, , and the shift-tilt motion
	to the difference between the lengths of the two backbone strands,
	?{C}. {W}e use this observation to develop a simple virtual bond
	model which describes the coupling of the backbone conformations

	connect the same strand {C}1?-{C}1? atoms. {A}nalysis of the {X}-ray

	14 local base stacking parameters. {U}sing this simple model for
	the backbone in conjunction with potential energy calculations of
	the base stacking interactions, we show that it is possible to predict
	accurately the values of these 14 base step parameters, given values
	of slide, shift and propeller. {W}e also show that the base step
	parameters fall into three distinct groups: roll, tilt and rise are
	determined solely by the base stacking interactions and are independent
	of the backbone; twist is insensitive to the base stacking interactions
	and is determined solely by the constraints of a relatively rigid
	fixed length backbone; slide and shift are the primary degrees of
	freedom and cannot be predicted accurately at the dinucleotide level
	because they are influenced by the conformations of neighbouring
	steps in a sequence. {W}e have found that the context effect on slide
	is mediated by the torsion angles while the context effect on shift
	results from a {BI} to {BII} transition in the backbone. {W}e have
	therefore reduced the dimensionality of the dinucleotide step problem
	to two parameters, slide and shift.},

	represent identifiable features or roles within

	(e.g., a1) or the dinucleotides (e.g., a1a1) that are especially

	We find that Na+ and Mg2+ play distinctive roles in helix–helix assembly.
	High [Na+] (>0.3 M) causes a reduced helix–helix electrostatic repulsion
	and a subsequent disordered packing of helices. In contrast, Mg2+
	of concentration >1 mM is predicted to induce helix–helix attraction
	and results in a more compact and ordered helix–helix packing. Mg2+
	is much more efficient in causing nucleic acid compaction. In addition,
	the free energy landscape shows that the tethering loops between
	the helices also play a significant role. A flexible loop, such as
	a neutral loop or a polynucleotide loop in high salt concentration,
	enhances the close approach of the helices in order to gain the loop
	entropy. On the other hand, a rigid loop, such as a polynucleotide
	loop in low salt concentration, tends to de-compact the helices.
	Therefore, a polynucleotide loop significantly enhances the sharpness
	of the ion-induced compaction transition. Moreover, we find that
	a larger number of helices in the system or a smaller radius of the
	divalent ions can cause a more abrupt compaction transition and a
	more compact state at high ion concentration, and the ion size effect

	approach
	
	for describing RNA structure in a simple, mathematically consistent,

	computationally accessible manner involves the invocation of two pseudotorsions,
	
	n (C4'n-1, Pn, C4'n, Pn+1) and t (Pn, C4'n, Pn+1, C4'n+1), which can

	used to describe RNA conformation in much the same way that phi and

	used to describe backbone configuration of proteins. Here, we conduct
	an
	
	exploration and statistical evaluation of pseudotorsional space and

	Ramachandran-like nabla–theta plot. We show that, through the rigorous
	
	quantitative analysis of the nabla–theta plot, the pseudotorsional

	contain considerable information about nucleotide base conformation,

	relevant regions of density in the nabla–theta scatter plot and then
	nucleotides in
	
	colocalized clusters in the nabla–theta plane are shown to have similar
	3-D
	
	structures through RMSD analysis of the RNA structural constituents.
	We
	
	find that major clusters in the nabla–theta plot are few, underscoring
	the discrete
	
	nature of RNA backbone conformation. Like the Ramachandran plot, the
	
	nabla–theta plot is a valuable system for conceptualizing biomolecular

  volume = {313},
  pages = {151-169},
  abstract = {We have used distributed computing techniques and a supercluster of
	
	thousands of computer processors to study folding of the C-terminal
	
	b-hairpin from protein G in atomistic detail using the GB/SA implicit
	
	solvent model at 300 K. We have simulated a total of nearly 38 ms
	of
	
	folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories.
	
	Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an
	
	unfolded state characterized by non-speci®c, temporary hydrogen
	
	bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between
	
	hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation
	
	of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same
	time
	
	that the ®nal hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin
	
	structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core
	and
	
	proper b-sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone
	
	hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the
	existing
	
	experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also
	
	reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which de®ne a thermodynamic
	
	trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with
	a
	
	single rate-limiting step in which a varying ®nal hydrogen bond pattern
	
	is apparent, and semi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear
	early
	
	in the folding process. We include details of the ensemble dynamics
	
	methodology and a discussion of our achievements using this new computational
	
	device for studying dynamics at the atomic level.},

  abstract = {D{NA} cyclization is potentially the most powerful approach for systematic
	quantitation of sequence-dependent {DNA} bending and flexibility.
	{W}e extend the statistical mechanics of the homogeneous {DNA} circle
	to a model that considers discrete basepairs, thus allowing for inhomogeneity,
	and apply the model to analysis of {DNA} cyclization. {T}he theory
	starts from an iterative search for the minimum energy configuration
	of circular {DNA}. {T}hermodynamic quantities such as the {J} factor,
	which is essentially the ratio of the partition functions of circular
	and linear forms, are evaluated by integrating the thermal fluctuations
	around the configuration under harmonic approximation. {A}ccurate
	analytic expressions are obtained for equilibrium configurations
	of homogeneous circular {DNA} with and without bending anisotropy.
	{J} factors for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous {DNA} are evaluated.
	{E}ffects of curvature, helical repeat, and bending and torsional
	flexibility in {DNA} cyclization are analyzed in detail, revealing
	that {DNA} cyclization can detect as little as one degree of curvature
	and a few percent change in flexibility. {J} factors calculated by
	our new approach are well consistent with {M}onte {C}arlo simulations,
	whereas the new theory has much greater efficiency in computations.
	{S}imulation of experimental results has been demonstrated.},
