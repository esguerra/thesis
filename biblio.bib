  abstract = {Over the past few years, it has become increasingly apparent that
	double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) plays a far greater role in the life
	cycle of a cell than previously expected. Numerous proteins, including
	helicases, polymerases, and nucleases interact specifically with
	the double helix of dsRNA. To understand the detailed nature of these
	dsRNA-protein interactions, the (bio)chemical, electrostatic, and
	mechanical properties of dsRNA need to be fully characterized. We
	present measurements of the persistence length of dsRNA using two
	different single-molecule techniques: magnetic tweezers and atomic
	force microscopy. We deduce a mean persistence length for long dsRNA
	molecules of 63.8 +/- 0.7 nm from force-extension measurements with
	the magnetic tweezers. We present atomic force microscopy images
	of dsRNA and demonstrate a new method for analyzing these, which
	yields an independent, yet consistent value of 62 +/- 2 nm for the
	persistence length. The introduction of these single-molecule techniques
	for dsRNA analysis opens the way for real-time, quantitative analysis
	of dsRNA-protein interactions.},

	1 through such an interaction, which has been characterized thermodynamically
	and kinetically for the ai5g intron. {U}sing this system, it was
	possible to test the morphological tolerances of the {GNRA} tetraloop
	involved in tertiary interactions. {T}he data presented herein show
	that a {GNRA} tetraloop can still participate in tertiary interaction
	after being physically cut at any phosphodiester linkage within the
	loop. {T}he "nicked tetraloop" can be expanded by many nucleotides
	in either direction and the covalently continuous loop can also be
	expanded without loss of interaction energy. {I}n the context of
	the nicked tetraloop, the second nucleotide of the tetraloop sequence
	can be completely deleted without loss of function. {B}y examining
	radical alterations in tetraloop structure, this study helps define
	the minimal sequence and structural requirements of a {GNRA} motif
	involved in long-range tertiary interaction. {I}t shows that "tetraloop"-like
	structures capable of forming tertiary interactions can be imbedded
	in unexpected contexts, such as internal loops and apparently open
	structure within {RNA}. {I}t demonstrates that pentaloops and hexaloops
	can form the same type of interaction, with almost equal affinity,
	as a tetraloop. {T}aken together, these data suggest a more generic
	term for the {GNRA} tetraloop-receptor interaction: {I}t is proposed
	herein that the term "{GNRA} tetraloop" be replaced by "{GN}n/{RA}",
	where n represents a variable number of nucleotides and / indicates
	that the loop can be divided and interrupted by other sequences.},

  title = {{tRNA's Wobble Decoding of the Genome: 40 Years of Modification}},
  journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {366},
  pages = {1-13},
  abstract = {The genetic code is degenerate, in that 20 amino acids are encoded
	by 61 triplet codes. In 1966, Francis Crick hypothesized that the
	cell's limited number of tRNAs decoded the genome by recognizing
	more than one codon. The ambiguity of that recognition resided in
	the third base-pair, giving rise to the Wobble Hypothesis. Post-transcriptional
	modifications at tRNA's wobble position 34, especially modifications
	of uridine 34, enable wobble to occur. The Modified Wobble Hypothesis
	proposed in 1991 that specific modifications of a tRNA wobble nucleoside
	shape the anticodon architecture in such a manner that interactions
	were restricted to the complementary base plus a single wobble pairing
	for amino acids with twofold degenerate codons. However, chemically
	different modifications at position 34 would expand the ability of
	a tRNA to read three or even four of the fourfold degenerate codons.
	One foundation of Crick's Wobble Hypothesis was that a near-constant
	geometry of canonical base-pairing be maintained in forming all three
	base-pairs between the tRNA anticodon and mRNA codon on the ribosome.
	In accepting an aminoacyl-tRNA, the ribosome requires maintenance
	of a specific geometry for the anticodon-codon base-pairing. However,
	it is the post-transcriptional modifications at tRNA wobble position
	34 and purine 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, that pre-structure
	the anticodon domain to ensure the correct codon binding. The modifications
	create both the architecture and the stability needed for decoding
	through restraints on anticodon stereochemistry and conformational
	space, and through selective hydrogen bonding. A physicochemical
	understanding of modified nucleoside contributions to the tRNA anticodon
	domain architecture and its decoding of the genome has advanced RNA
	world evolutionary theory, the principles of RNA chemistry, and the
	application of this knowledge to the introduction of new amino acids
	to proteins.},

  abstract = {The kink turn (K-turn) is an RNA structural motif found in many biologically
	significant RNAs. While most examples of the K-turn have a similar
	fold, the crystal structure of the Azoarcus group I intron revealed
	a novel RNA conformation, a reverse kink turn bent in the direction
	opposite that of a consensus K-turn. The reverse K-turn is bent toward
	the major grooves rather than the minor grooves of the flanking helices,
	yet the sequence differs from the K-turn consensus by only a single
	nucleotide. Here we demonstrate that the reverse bend direction is
	not solely defined by internal sequence elements, but is instead
	affected by structural elements external to the K-turn. It bends
	toward the major groove under the direction of a tetraloop-tetraloop
	receptor. The ability of one sequence to form two distinct structures
	demonstrates the inherent plasticity of the K-turn sequence. Such
	plasticity suggests that the K-turn is not a primary element in RNA
	folding, but instead is shaped by other structural elements within
	the RNA or ribonucleoprotein assembly.},

  abstract = {The vibrational dynamics of transfer {RNA}s, both free, and complexed
	with the cognate synthetase, are analyzed using a model ({G}aussian
	network model) which recently proved to satisfactorily describe the
	collective motions of folded proteins. {T}he approach is similar
	to a normal mode analysis, with the major simplification that no
	residue specificity is taken into consideration, which permits us
	(i) to cast the problem into an analytical form applicable to biomolecular
	systems including about 103residues, and (ii) to acquire information
	on the essential dynamics of such large systems within computational
	times at least two orders of magnitude shorter than conventional
	simulations. {O}n a local scale, the fluctuations calculated for
	yeast t{RNAP}he and t{RNAA}sp in the free state, and for t{RNAG}lncomplexed
	with glutaminyl-t{RNA} synthetase ({G}ln{RS}) are in good agreement
	with the corresponding crystallographic {B} factors. {O}n a global
	scale, a hinge-bending region comprising nucleotides {U}8 to {C}12
	in the {D} arm, {G}20 to {G}22 in the {D} loop, and m7{G}46 to {C}48
	in the variable loop (for t{RNAP}he), is identified in the free t{RNA},
	conforming with previous observations. {T}he two regions subject
	to the largest amplitude anticorrelated fluctuations in the free
	form, i.e. the anticodon region and the acceptor arm are, at the
	same time, the regions that experience the most severe suppression
	in their flexibilities upon binding to synthetase, suggesting that
	their sampling of the conformational space facilitates their recognition
	by the synthetase. {L}ikewise, examination of the global mode of
	motion of {G}ln{RS} in the complex indicates that residues 40 to
	45, 260 to 270, 306 to 314, 320 to 327 and 478 to 485, all of which
	cluster near the {ATP} binding site, form a hinge-bending region
	controlling the cooperative motion, and thereby the catalytic function,

	domain, on the other hand, are distinguished by their high mobilities
	in the global modes of motion, a feature typical of recognition sites,
	also observed for other proteins. {M}ost of the conserved bases and

  abstract = {The folding of DNA on the nucleosome core particle governs many fundamental
	issues in eukaryotic molecular biology. In this study, an updated
	set of sequence-dependent empirical "energy" functions, derived from
	the structures of other protein-bound DNA molecules, is used to investigate
	the extent to which the architecture of nucleosomal DNA is dictated
	by its underlying sequence. The potentials are used to estimate the
	cost of deforming a collection of sequences known to bind or resist
	uptake in nucleosomes along various left-handed superhelical pathways
	and to deduce the features of sequence contributing to a particular
	structural form. The deformation scores reflect the choice of template,
	the deviations of structural parameters at each step of the nucleosome-bound
	DNA from their intrinsic values, and the sequence-dependent "deformability"
	of a given dimer. The correspondence between the computed scores
	and binding propensities points to a subtle interplay between DNA
	sequence and nucleosomal folding, e.g., sequences with periodically
	spaced pyrimidine-purine steps deform at low cost along a kinked
	template whereas sequences that resist deformation prefer a smoother
	spatial pathway. Successful prediction of the known settings of some
	of the best-resolved nucleosome-positioning sequences, however, requires
	a template with "kink-and-slide" steps like those found in high-resolution
	nucleosome structures.},

	specifically, planes which contain important pharmacophore elements.
	Relevant code from the 3DNA software
	
	package (Nucleic Acids Res. 2003, 31, 5108-5121) was generalized to
	treat molecular fragments other than
	
	DNA bases as input for the calculation of the corresponding rigid-body
	(or “planes”) parameters. These
	
	parameters were used to construct feature vectors for a fuzzy relational
	clustering study of over 700
	
	conformations of a flexible analogue of the dopamine reuptake inhibitor,
	GBR 12909. Several cluster validity
	
	measures were used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Translational

	coordinates and angles between molecular planes used in our previous
	fuzzy relational clustering of the
	
	same data set (J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2005, 45, 610-623), is that the

	of molecular superposition and the technique is able to identify clusters

	whole. This approach is easily generalizable to any two planes in
	any molecule.},

	at the termini of oligoribonucleotide Watson-Crick helixes (DeltaG(0)37,stack)

	Here, these free energies are correlated with stacking at helix termini
	in a database of 34 RNA structures determined by X-ray crystallography
	and NMR spectroscopy. Stacking involving GA pairs is considered separately.
	A base is categorized as stacked by its distance from (</=4.0 A),
	angle with (</=30 degrees), and overlap with the terminal helix base-pair.
	A base is unstacked if it does not satisfy one or more of these criteria.
	Of the 36 unpaired bases in sequences with DeltaG(0)37,stackmore
	favorable than -0.7 kcal/mol, 30 (83 \%) are stacked on the adjacent
	base-pair, indicating a propensity for such sequences to stack in
	the 3D structure. Structures containing the strongly stacked sequence
	[sequence: see text] show that the amino group of C closely overlaps
	the carbonyl-4 of U. Thermodynamic measurement of U stacking on a
	2-pyrimidinone-guanine base-pair, where the amino group of C is replaced
	by hydrogen, suggests that interactions with the cytosine amino group
	contribute approximately 0.5 kcal/mol to DeltaG(0)37,stack. For GA
	mismatches at helix termini, the nucleotide at the 3' helix end is
	always stacked, and the nucleotide at the 5' end is stacked in almost
	90 \% of occurrences. In available structures, non-Watson-Crick paired
	bases 3' to an imino-hydrogen bonded GA are also always stacked;
	the GA provides a large platform for favorable stacking. For the
	56 sequences associated with DeltaG(0)37,stackless favorable than
	-0.4 kcal/mol, 19 (34 \%) are stacked; these sequences have a propensity
	for not stacking on adjacent base-pairs. Phylogenetic conservation
	of weakly stacking sequences at 3' ends may be a predictor of a backbone

	the helices and the lattice representation for the loops are

	the present virtual bond model can account for the atomic details

  abstract = {The histone-like HU (heat unstable) protein plays a key role in the
	organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli genome. The nonspecific
	nature of HU binding to DNA complicates analysis of the mechanism
	by which the protein contributes to the looping of DNA. Conventional
	models of the looping of HU-bound duplexes attribute the changes
	in biophysical properties of DNA brought about by the random binding
	of protein to changes in the effective parameters of an ideal helical
	wormlike chain. Here, we introduce a novel Monte Carlo approach to
	study the effects of nonspecific HU binding on the configurational
	properties of DNA directly. We randomly decorated segments of an
	ideal double-helical DNA with HU molecules that induce the bends
	and other structural distortions of the double helix find in currently
	available X-ray structures. We find that the presence of HU at levels
	approximating those found in the cell reduces the persistence length
	by roughly threefold compared with that of naked DNA. The binding
	of protein has particularly striking effects on the cyclization properties
	of short duplexes, altering the dependence of ring closure on chain
	length in a way that cannot be mimicked by a simple wormlike model
	and accumulating at higher-than-expected levels on successfully closed
	chains. Moreover, the uptake of protein on small minicircles depends
	on chain length, taking advantage of the HU-induced deformations
	of DNA structure to facilitate ligation. Circular duplexes with bound
	HU show much greater propensity than protein-free DNA to exist as
	negatively supercoiled topoisomers, suggesting a potential role of
	HU in organizing the bacterial nucleoid. The local bending and undertwisting
	of DNA by HU, in combination with the number of bound proteins, provide
	a structural rationale for the condensation of DNA and the observed
	expression levels of reporter genes in vivo.},

  abstract = {A new, computationally efficient Monte Carlo approach has been developed
	to
	
	estimate the ring-closure properties of short, realistically modeled
	DNA chains. The double helix
	
	is treated at the level of base-pair steps using an elastic potential
	that accounts for the sequencedependent
	
	variability in the intrinsic structure and elastic moduli of the base-pair
	steps, including
	
	the known coupling of conformational variables. Rather than using
	traditional Metropolis-Monte
	
	Carlo techniques to generate representative configurations, a Gaussian
	sampling method is
	
	introduced to construct three-dimensional structures from linear combinations
	of the rigid-body
	
	parameters defining the relative orientation and displacement of successive
	base pairs. The
	
	computation of the J factor, the well-known ratio of the equilibrium
	constants for cyclization vs
	
	bimolecular association of a linear molecule, takes into account restrictions
	on the displacement
	
	and directions of the base pairs joined in ring closure, including
	the probability that the end-toend
	
	vector is null and the terminal base pairs coincide. The increased

	assess the likelihood that very short chains satisfy these criteria
	are attained using the
	
	Alexandrowicz half-chain sampling enhancement technique in combination

	of the two-half-chain segments. The method is used to investigate
	the cyclization properties of
	
	arbitrary-length DNA with greatly enhanced sampling sizes, i.e., O(1014)

	estimate J factors lower than 0.1 pM with high accuracy. The methodology

	naturally straight, DNA elastic rod and then applied to investigate
	the extent to which one can
	
	account for the unexpectedly large J factors of short DNA chains without
	the need to invoke
	
	significant distortions of double helical structure. Several well-known
	structural features of DNAs
	
	including the presence of intrinsic curvature, roll-twist coupling,
	or enhanced pyrimidine-purine
	
	deformabilitysbring the computed J factors in line with the observed

	We describe here a complementary approach, inspired by the Rosetta

	using evolutionary information. In a benchmark test of 20 RNA sequences
	with known structure and lengths of approximately 30 nt, the new

	with the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods. In more

	the native structure to better than 4 A rmsd over the backbone. Most
	importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson-Crick
	base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of "sheared"
	base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical
	features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of

	similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but

	a severe obstacle to computer modeling of {RNA}. {T}he computational
	feasibility of {RNA} conformational searches can be enhanced by assigning
	to each nucleotide a set of discrete conformations. {I}n this work,
	four types of discrete conformational sets for the atomic representation
	of nucleotide structures were defined and evaluated. {T}hese sets,
	comprising between 10 and 30 conformations, were tested for their
	ability to reproduce known {RNA} structures and to generate structures
	responding to new specifications. {C}onformational searches were
	performed with the {MC}-{SYM} program, which allows for the generation
	of all structures satisfying a predetermined set of three-dimensional
	constraints in a given discrete space. {R}esults with known hairpin
	loop structures show that root-mean-square deviations of about 1ï¿½5
	ï¿½ for backbone atoms and about 2?0 ï¿½ for all atoms between the
	modeled and {X}-ray crystal structures can be expected. {T}he conformational
	set that gives the most faithful representation of test structures
	is based on the classification of nucleotide conformations derived
	from a structural database. {R}epresentative conformations are selected
	from each class that adequately sample variations in backbone direction,
	sugar pucker and base orientation. {W}ith this conformational set,
	most of the important features of test hairpin structures are reproduced
	with fidelity, indicating that biologically useful models can be
	constructed from the combination of discrete nucleotide conformations
	and an algorithm that rapidly and systematically scans the pre-defined

  abstract = {The function of a non-protein-coding RNA is often determined by its
	structure. Since experimental determination of RNA structure is time-consuming
	and expensive, its computational prediction is of great interest,
	and efficient solutions based on thermodynamic parameters are known.
	Frequently, however, the predicted minimum free energy structures
	are not the native ones, leading to the necessity of generating suboptimal
	solutions. While this can be accomplished by a number of programs,
	the user is often confronted with large outputs of similar structures,
	although he or she is interested in structures with more fundamental
	differences, or, in other words, with different abstract shapes.
	Here, we formalize the concept of abstract shapes and introduce their
	efficient computation. Each shape of an RNA molecule comprises a
	class of similar structures and has a representative structure of
	minimal free energy within the class. Shape analysis is implemented
	in the program RNAshapes. We applied RNAshapes to the prediction
	of optimal and suboptimal abstract shapes of several RNAs. For a
	given energy range, the number of shapes is considerably smaller
	than the number of structures, and in all cases, the native structures
	were among the top shape representatives. This demonstrates that
	the researcher can quickly focus on the structures of interest, without
	processing up to thousands of near-optimal solutions. We complement
	this study with a large-scale analysis of the growth behaviour of
	structure and shape spaces. RNAshapes is available for download and

  abstract = {Both microscopic and macroscopic models of DNA flexibility should
	lead to the same quantitative description of the elastic properties
	of the DNA helix. This belief is reinforced by the fact that essentially
	all experimental (solution) studies to date support the macroscopic,
	elastic model. The performance of microscopic models can therefore
	be checked by their ability to produce the correct macroscopic quantities
	(P and C). To most carefully address the influence of such factors
	as base sequence, DNA damage, and drug or protein interaction on
	the flexibility of DNA, methods are required that are most sensitive
	for DNA molecules of less than 500-1000 bp. The use of molecules
	in this size range will maximize the signal due to the structural
	alteration as well as facilitate the construction of DNA sequences
	of any desired arrangement. I have emphasized three such methods
	and summarized their strengths and weaknesses; however, their concurrent
	application to the determination of DNA flexibility provides an important
	check of self-consistency. These studies have indicated that the
	persistence length of DNA in buffers of moderate salt concentration
	is 450-500 A. Synthetic DNA is now readily available, and many procedures
	for the construction and cloning of DNA molecules of defined length
	and sequence (107-108a) are in common use. The availability of restriction
	fragments of precisely defined length has transformed the study of
	the physical (particularly hydrodynamic) properties of such molecules,
	since the hitherto pervasive problem of length polydispersity has
	been eliminated. Sheared, sonicated, or otherwise abused calf thymus
	(or other) DNAs should no longer be considered acceptable materials
	for physical studies. Many studies of bending and torsional fluctuations
	in DNA have been excluded from this discussion because the DNA samples
	used were not precisely defined. The torsional elastic constant of
	DNA has been fairly well established as approximately 3.0 x 10(-19)
	erg-cm, mainly through a combination of elegant theoretical and experimental
	studies of topoisomer distributions in circular DNA molecules. The
	other general approach to the determination of the torsional elastic
	constant, luminescence decay, is still burdened by the poor characterization
	of the DNA used in many of the experimental studies as well as by
	some continued theoretical uncertainties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of novel biological knowledge from the ab
	initio analysis of post-genomic data relies upon the use of unsupervised
	processing methods, in particular clustering techniques. Much recent
	research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer
	of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on
	the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle
	the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned
	by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection
	and concordance with prior biological knowledge--whether the clusters
	actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat
	less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation
	techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but
	have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics.
	RESULTS: This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the
	battery of techniques available for the validation of clustering
	results, with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic
	data analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to
	demonstrate the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical

  abstract = {Duplex DNA must remain stable when not in use to protect the genetic
	material. However, the two strands must be separated whenever genes
	are copied or expressed to expose the coding strand for synthesis
	of complementary RNA or DNA bases. Therefore, the double stranded
	structure must be relatively easy to take apart when required. These
	conflicting biological requirements have important implications for
	the mechanical properties of duplex DNA. Considerable insight into
	the forces required to denature DNA has been provided by nanomanipulation
	experiments, which measure the mechanical properties of single molecules
	in the laboratory. This paper describes recent computer simulation
	methods that have been developed to mimic nanomanipulation experiments
	and which, quite literally, 'destruction test' duplex DNA in silico.
	The method is verified by comparison with single molecule stretching
	experiments that measure the force required to unbind the two DNA
	strands. The model is then extended to investigate the thermodynamics
	of DNA bending and twisting. This is of biological importance as
	the DNA must be very tightly packaged to fit within the nucleus,
	and is therefore usually found in a highly twisted or supercoiled
	state (in bacteria) or wrapped tightly around histone proteins into
	a densely compacted structure (in animals). In particular, these
	simulations highlight the importance of thermal fluctuations and
	entropy in determining the biomechanical properties of DNA. This
	has implications for the action of DNA processing molecular motors,
	and also for nanotechnology. Biological machines are able to manipulate
	single molecules reliably on an energy scale comparable to that of
	thermal noise. The hope is that understanding the statistical mechanisms
	that a cell uses to achieve this will be invaluable for the future
	design of 'nanoengines' engineered to perform new technological functions

	to work, the first step is to cut the protein sequence into fragments
	that form local minima on the polypeptide chain. {T}he conformations

	the fragments are embedded in the native fold, although alternate
	conformations may be favored during the mutual stabilization in the
	combinatorial assembly process. {T}wo elements are needed for such
	cutting: (1) a library of (clustered) fragments derived from known
	protein structures and (2) an assignment algorithm that selects optimal
	combinations to "cover" the protein sequence. {T}he next two steps

  pages = {20288-20293},
  abstract = {Single-molecule force spectroscopy methods can be used to generate
	folding trajectories of biopolymers from arbitrary regions of the
	folding landscape. We illustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics
	and generic aspects of the collapse of RNA and proteins upon force
	quench by using simulations of an RNA hairpin and theory based on
	the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The folding time, tau(F),
	depends asymmetrically on deltaf(S) = f (S) - f (m) and deltaf (Q)
	= f (m) - f (Q) where f (S) (f (Q)) is the stretch (quench) force
	and f (m) is the transition midforce of the RNA hairpin. In accord
	with experiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension,
	R(t), occurs in three stages: A rapid initial decrease in the extension
	is followed by a plateau and finally, an abrupt reduction in R(t)
	occurs as the native state is approached. The duration of the plateau
	increases as lambda = tau (Q)/tau (F) decreases (where tau (Q) is
	the time in which the force is reduced from f (S) to f (Q)). Variations
	in the mechanisms of force-quench relaxation as lambda is altered
	are reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy,
	which is computed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical
	solution of the de Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage
	stage kinetics in R(t). The prediction that the initial stages of
	collapse should also be a generic feature of polymers is validated
	by simulation of the kinetics of toroid (globule) formation in semiflexible
	(flexible) homopolymers in poor solvents upon quenching the force
	from a fully stretched state. Our findings give a unified explanation
	for multiple disparate experimental observations of protein folding.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recent development of methods for modeling RNA 3D
	structures using coarse-grain approaches creates a need to bridge
	low- and high-resolution modeling methods. Although they contain
	topological information, coarse-grain models lack atomic detail,
	which limits their utility for some applications. RESULTS: We have
	developed a method for adding full atomic detail to coarse-grain
	models of RNA 3D structures. Our method [Coarse to Atomic (C2A)]
	uses geometries observed in known RNA crystal structures. Our method
	rebuilds full atomic detail from ideal coarse-grain backbones taken
	from crystal structures to within 1.87-3.31 A RMSD of the full atomic
	crystal structure. When starting from coarse-grain models generated
	by the modeling tool NAST, our method builds full atomic structures
	that are within 1.00 A RMSD of the starting structure. The resulting
	full atomic structures can be used as starting points for higher
	resolution modeling, thus bridging high- and low-resolution approaches
	to modeling RNA 3D structure. AVAILABILITY: Code for the C2A method,

	present a protocol (the nucleic acid simulation tool [NAST]) for
	RNA modeling that uses an RNA-specific knowledge-based potential
	in a coarse-grained molecular dynamics engine to generate plausible
	3D structures. We demonstrate NAST's capabilities by using only secondary

	388-residue T. thermophila group I intron. One advantage of NAST
	is the ability to rank clusters of structurally similar decoys based
	on their compatibility with experimental data. We successfully used
	ideal small-angle X-ray scattering data and both ideal and experimental
	solvent accessibility data to select the best cluster of structures

	Although the role of polyamines in DNA condensation is well known,
	their role in RNA folding is less understood. Non-denaturing gel
	electrophoresis was used to monitor the equilibrium folding transitions
	of the Tetrahymena ribozyme in the presence of polyamines. All of
	the polyamines tested induce near-native structures that readily
	convert to the native conformation in Mg2+. The stability of the
	folded structure increases with the charge of the polyamine and decreases
	with the size of the polyamine. When the counterion excluded volume
	becomes large, the transition to the native state does not go to
	completion even under favorable folding conditions. Brownian dynamics
	simulations of a model polyelectrolyte suggest that the kinetics
	of counterion-mediated collapse and the dimensions of the collapsed
	RNA chains depend on the structure of the counterion. The results
	are consistent with delocalized condensation of polyamines around
	the RNA. However, the effective charge of the counterions is lowered
	by their excluded volume. The stability of the folded RNA is enhanced
	when the spacing between amino groups matches the distance between
	adjacent phosphate groups. These results show how changes in intracellular

	be stretched by a factor of two and compressed roughly in half before

  journal = {Journal of Molecular Biology},
  year = {2009},

  pages = {67-82},
  abstract = {RNA junctions are secondary-structure elements formed when three or
	more helices come together. They are present in diverse RNA molecules
	with various fundamental functions in the cell. To better understand
	the intricate architecture of three-dimensional (3D) RNAs, we analyze
	currently solved 3D RNA junctions in terms of base-pair interactions
	and 3D configurations. First, we study base-pair interaction diagrams
	for solved RNA junctions with 5 to 10 helices and discuss common
	features. Second, we compare these higher-order junctions to those
	containing 3 or 4 helices and identify global motif patterns such
	as coaxial stacking and parallel and perpendicular helical configurations.
	These analyses show that higher-order junctions organize their helical
	components in parallel and helical configurations similar to lower-order
	junctions. Their sub-junctions also resemble local helical configurations
	found in three- and four-way junctions and are stabilized by similar
	long-range interaction preferences such as A-minor interactions.
	Furthermore, loop regions within junctions are high in adenine but
	low in cytosine, and in agreement with previous studies, we suggest
	that coaxial stacking between helices likely forms when the common
	single-stranded loop is small in size; however, other factors such
	as stacking interactions involving noncanonical base pairs and proteins
	can greatly determine or disrupt coaxial stacking. Finally, we introduce
	the ribo-base interactions: when combined with the along-groove packing
	motif, these ribo-base interactions form novel motifs involved in
	perpendicular helix-helix interactions. Overall, these analyses suggest
	recurrent tertiary motifs that stabilize junction architecture, pack
	helices, and help form helical configurations that occur as sub-elements
	of larger junction networks. The frequent occurrence of similar helical
	motifs suggest nature's finite and perhaps limited repertoire of
	RNA helical conformation preferences. More generally, studies of
	RNA junctions and tertiary building blocks can ultimately help in
	the difficult task of RNA 3D structure prediction.},

  abstract = {RNA secondary structures can be divided into helical regions composed
	of canonical Watson-Crick and related base pairs, as well as single-stranded
	regions such as hairpin loops, internal loops, and junctions. These
	elements function as building blocks in the design of diverse RNA
	molecules with various fundamental functions in the cell. To better
	understand the intricate architecture of three-dimensional (3D) RNAs,
	we analyze existing RNA four-way junctions in terms of base-pair
	interactions and 3D configurations. Specifically, we identify nine
	broad junction families according to coaxial stacking patterns and
	helical configurations. We find that helices within junctions tend
	to arrange in roughly parallel and perpendicular patterns and stabilize
	their conformations using common tertiary motifs such as coaxial
	stacking, loop-helix interaction, and helix packing interaction.
	Our analysis also reveals a number of highly conserved base-pair
	interaction patterns and novel tertiary motifs such as A-minor-coaxial
	stacking combinations and sarcin/ricin motif variants. Such analyses
	of RNA building blocks can ultimately help in the difficult task

	We demonstrate that the simulations are converged in terms of helical

	Flanking base sequences can notably lead to base pair step parameters

	different random-walk chains by using energy minimization, allowing

	we model DNA* as identical to ordinary DNA but supplemented by a
	longitudinal compression force equal in magnitude but oppositely
	directed to the stretching (tension) force on DNA caused by phosphate-phosphate
	repulsions. The null isomer DNA* then becomes an elastically buckled
	form of fully ionized DNA. On this basis, we derive a nonadditive
	relationship between the persistence length P of DNA and the persistence
	length P* of its null isomer. From the formula obtained we can predict
	the value of P* if P is known, and we can predict the ionic strength
	dependence of P under the assumption that P* does not depend on ionic
	strength. We predict a value of P* for null DNA drastically lower

	phosphates. The predicted dependence of P on salt concentration is
	log-c over most of the concentration range, with no tendency toward

	for determining a secondary structure either by comparative sequence

	is a new computer algorithm that improves the accuracy of structure
	prediction by combining free energy minimization and comparative
	sequence analysis to find a low free energy structure common to two
	sequences without requiring any sequence identity. It uses a dynamic
	programming construct suggested by Sankoff. Dynalign, however, restricts
	the maximum distance, M, allowed between aligned nucleotides in the
	two sequences. This makes the calculation tractable because the complexity
	is simplified to O(M(3)N(3)), where N is the length of the shorter
	sequence. The accuracy of Dynalign was tested with sets of 13 tRNAs,
	seven 5 S rRNAs, and two R2 3' UTR sequences. On average, Dynalign

  abstract = {Fine structural and energetic details embedded in the DNA base sequence,
	such as intrinsic curvature, are important to the packaging and processing
	of the genetic material. Here we investigate the internal dynamics
	of a 200 bp closed circular molecule with natural curvature using
	a newly developed normal-mode treatment of DNA in terms of neighboring
	base-pair "step" parameters. The intrinsic curvature of the DNA is
	described by a 10 bp repeating pattern of bending distortions at
	successive base-pair steps. We vary the degree of intrinsic curvature
	and the superhelical stress on the molecule and consider the normal-mode
	fluctuations of both the circle and the stable figure-8 configuration
	under conditions where the energies of the two states are similar.
	To extract the properties due solely to curvature, we ignore other
	important features of the double helix, such as the extensibility
	of the chain, the anisotropy of local bending, and the coupling of
	step parameters. We compare the computed normal modes of the curved
	DNA model with the corresponding dynamical features of a covalently
	closed duplex of the same chain length constructed from naturally
	straight DNA and with the theoretically predicted dynamical properties
	of a naturally circular, inextensible elastic rod, i.e., an O-ring.
	The cyclic molecules with intrinsic curvature are found to be more
	deformable under superhelical stress than rings formed from naturally
	straight DNA. As superhelical stress is accumulated in the DNA, the
	frequency, i.e., energy, of the dominant bending mode decreases in
	value, and if the imposed stress is sufficiently large, a global
	configurational rearrangement of the circle to the figure-8 form
	takes place. We combine energy minimization with normal-mode calculations
	of the two states to decipher the configurational pathway between
	the two states. We also describe and make use of a general analytical
	treatment of the thermal fluctuations of an elastic rod to characterize
	the motions of the minicircle as a whole from knowledge of the full
	set of normal modes. The remarkable agreement between computed and
	theoretically predicted values of the average deviation and dispersion
	of the writhe of the circular configuration adds to the reliability

	130 structures of adenine dimers in stacked conformations, with special
	attention given to dimers that are either vertically compressed (parallel
	structures) or contain close interatomic contacts (non-parallel structures).
	Such geometries are sampled during thermal fluctuations of nucleic
	acids and contribute to the local conformational variability of these
	systems. Their theoretical characterization requires a good description
	of interaction energies in the short-range repulsion region. The
	reference calculations have been performed with the CBS(T) method,
	i.e., MP2/CBS computations corrected for higher-order electron-correlation
	effects using the CCSD(T) method. These benchmark data have been
	used to examine the performance of the DFT-D, SCS(MI)-MP2, MP2.5,
	M06-2X and CBS(SCS-D) quantum-mechanical methods, and of the AMBER
	Cornell et al. force field. The present results, as well as those
	of our previous study on stacked uracil dimers, confirm that the
	force field severely exaggerates the repulsion at short intermolecular
	distances. This behavior complicates the use of the force field in
	scans of the stacking-energy dependence on local conformational parameters
	in nucleic acids. Compared against the previous results obtained
	in the uracil dimer study, the performance of DFT-D to describe stacking
	at short intermolecular distances has worsened, showing for the adenine
	dimers a larger exaggeration of the repulsion, especially for structures
	where the monomers are parallel to each other. Despite these deviations,
	the performance of DFT-D is still reasonably good and this method
	provides, for example, a relatively inexpensive way to monitor stacking
	energies along molecular dynamics trajectories. The best performers
	are the MP2.5, SCS(MI)-MP2, and CBS(SCS-D) methods. In addition,
	the energy profiles given by the SCS(MI)-MP2 and CBS(SCS-D) methods
	are the ones that most closely resemble the CBS(T) data. Interestingly,
	the performance of the SCS(MI)-MP2 method for stacked adenine dimers
	is better than for stacked uracil dimers, indicating that the quality
	of the description may vary with the nucleobase composition. Even
	though the SCS(MI)-MP2 method cannot match the speed of DFT-D, the
	results so far render it a promising tool to study intrinsic interactions
	in systems of moderate size. In general, for most applications all
	the QM methods tested here are of sufficient accuracy.},

	of 20 ï¿½ of 70 S ribosomes in the pre-translocational state, carrying
	tRNA molecules at the A and P sites. The fit to the 30 S moiety of
	the 70 S particles was accomplished with the help of the well-known
	distribution of the ribosomal proteins in the head, body and side
	lobe regions of the 30 S subunit, as determined by immuno electron
	microscopy (IEM). Most of the protein mass centres were found to
	lie close to the surface (or even outside) of the cryo-EM contour
	of the 30 S subunit, supporting the idea that the ribosomal proteins
	are arranged peripherally around the rRNA. The ribosomal protein
	distribution was then compared with the corresponding model for the
	16 S rRNA, fitted to the same EM contour (described in an accompanying
	paper), in order to analyse the mutual compatibility of the arrangement
	of proteins and rRNA in terms of the available RNA-protein interaction
	data. The information taken into account included the hydroxyl radical
	and base foot-printing data from Nollerï¿½s laboratory, and our own
	in situ cross-linking results. Proteins S1 and S14 were not considered,
	due to the lack of RNA-protein data. Among the 19 proteins analysed,
	12 (namely S2, S4, S5, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S15, S17 and S21)

	at least acceptable. Of the remaining 7, S3 and S13 showed a rather
	poor fit, as did S18 (which is considered in combination with S6
	in the foot-printing experiments). S16 was difficult to evaluate,
	as the foot-print data for this protein cover a large area of the
	rRNA. S19 and S20 showed a bad fit in terms of the neutron map, but
	their foot-print and cross-link sites were clustered into compact

	definitions are needed that specify the core nucleotides of each

  pages = {530-554},
  abstract = {Matrix-generator and Monte Carlo methods have been employed to study
	the influence of thermal fluctuations on the overall sizes and shapes
	of curved pieces of DNA. The DNA model involves the independent angular
	parameters relating successive base-pair steps: the sequence-dependent
	equilibrium values and fluctuations of the twist, tilt, and roll
	angles. The curved sequence under study is the (A5X5)n repeating
	polymer, the AA and XX steps having different equilibrium roll and
	twist values. Both planar circles and superhelices are analysed.
	Detailed comparison is made between the rigorous statistical mechanical
	representation of the DNA and simplified static models currently
	used in the literature. That is, a more realistic "flexible wedge"
	model is contrasted with the existing "static wedge" model of DNA
	curvature, which is demonstrated to be inadequate. The size of the
	coils is described by the unperturbed root-mean-square end-to-end
	distance and the shape by a ratio of the principal moments of the
	radius of gyration. The moment ratios indicate that when DNA is relatively
	short (e.g. its length is shorter than half a turn of the static
	superhelix), the flexible chains are more "short and thick" than
	the static structure. The end-to-end distances, however, are practically
	the same in the two models. For longer DNA fragments, the flexible
	chain is more extended in terms of the end-to-end distance and more
	globular in terms of the moment ratio. Thus, fluctuations "blur"
	the curvature of longer DNA fragments compared with static models.
	Furthermore, the overall average shape of slightly curved DNA subject
	to natural bending and twisting fluctuations is essentially indistinguishable
	from that of the corresponding "straight" DNA. Such configurational
	similarities are apparently responsible for the relative insensitivity
	of the polyacrylamide gel matrix to small degrees of DNA curvature.
	These findings raise serious questions regarding the quantitative
	estimation of wedge angles in DNA from electrophoretic experiments,
	based on static models. Comparison between planar circles and superhelices
	shows that when fluctuations are considered, the flexible circles
	are more spherical than the superhelices. The results imply that
	when DNA bending is exactly "in phase" with the helical repeat (i.e.
	when the DNA loop is exactly planar at 0 K), the DNA coil is packed
	more tightly than when bending and twisting are "out of phase" (and
	a superhelix is formed at 0 K). This finding is consistent with polyacrylamide
	gel electrophoresis data testifying to an increase in DNA retardation
	when twisting is more precisely "tuned".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

	angles (, , and ) comprise two less important degrees of freedom.
	{T}he base stacking interactions show three degrees of freedom: slide-roll-twist,
	shift-tilt, and rise (which is more or less constant). {C}oupling
	is observed between the base and backbone degrees of freedom. {T}he
	major base stacking mode, slide-roll-twist, is coupled to the major
	backbone mode, -{P}--. {T}he secondary base stacking mode, shift-tilt,
	is coupled to and and to a lesser extent to the -{P}-- mode. {W}e
	show that the length of the backbone, {C}, given by the same strand
	{C}1?-{C}1? separation, is an excellent single parameter descriptor
	for the conformation of the backbone and the way in which it is coupled
	to the base stacking geometry. {T}he slide-roll-twist motion relates
	to changes in the mean backbone length, , and the shift-tilt motion
	to the difference between the lengths of the two backbone strands,
	?{C}. {W}e use this observation to develop a simple virtual bond

	connect the same strand {C}1?-{C}1? atoms. {A}nalysis of the {X}-ray

	14 local base stacking parameters. {U}sing this simple model for
	the backbone in conjunction with potential energy calculations of
	the base stacking interactions, we show that it is possible to predict
	accurately the values of these 14 base step parameters, given values
	of slide, shift and propeller. {W}e also show that the base step
	parameters fall into three distinct groups: roll, tilt and rise are
	determined solely by the base stacking interactions and are independent
	of the backbone; twist is insensitive to the base stacking interactions
	and is determined solely by the constraints of a relatively rigid
	fixed length backbone; slide and shift are the primary degrees of
	freedom and cannot be predicted accurately at the dinucleotide level
	because they are influenced by the conformations of neighbouring
	steps in a sequence. {W}e have found that the context effect on slide
	is mediated by the torsion angles while the context effect on shift
	results from a {BI} to {BII} transition in the backbone. {W}e have
	therefore reduced the dimensionality of the dinucleotide step problem
	to two parameters, slide and shift.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION AND RESULTS: Motivated by the recent rise of interest in
	small regulatory RNAs, we present Locomotif--a new approach for locating
	RNA motifs that goes beyond the previous ones in three ways: (1)
	motif search is based on efficient dynamic programming algorithms,
	incorporating the established thermodynamic model of RNA secondary
	structure formation. (2) motifs are described graphically, using
	a Java-based editor, and search algorithms are derived from the graphics
	in a fully automatic way. The editor allows us to draw secondary
	structures, annotated with size and sequence information. They closely
	resemble the established, but informal way in which RNA motifs are
	communicated in the literature. Thus, the learning effort for Locomotif
	users is minimal. (3) Locomotif employs a client-server approach.
	Motifs are designed by the user locally. Search programs are generated
	and compiled on a bioinformatics server. They are made available
	both for execution on the server, and for download as C source code
	plus an appropriate makefile. AVAILABILITY: Locomotif is available

	the cPCA using the Cartesian coordinates of all atoms, the dPCA using
	the sine/cosine-transformed six backbone dihedral angles as well
	as the glycosidic torsional angle chi and the pseudorotational angle
	P, the aPCA which ignores the circularity of the 6 + 2 dihedral angles
	of the RNA, and the dPCA(etatheta), which approximates the 6 backbone
	dihedral angles by 2 pseudotorsional angles eta and theta. As representative
	examples, a 10-nucleotide UUCG hairpin and the 36-nucleotide segment
	SL1 of the Psi site of HIV-1 are studied by classical molecular dynamics
	simulation, using the Amber all-atom force field and explicit solvent.
	It is shown that the conformational heterogeneity of the RNA hairpins
	can only be resolved by an angular PCA such as the dPCA but not by
	the cPCA using Cartesian coordinates. Apart from possible artifacts
	due to the coupling of overall and internal motion, this is because
	the details of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions but also
	of global structural rearrangements of the RNA are better discriminated
	by dihedral angles. In line with recent experiments, it is found
	that the free energy landscape of RNA hairpins is quite rugged and

	chloroplast 5S rRNA Loop E motifs. The Loop E sequences form unique
	duplex architectures composed of seven consecutive non-Watson-Crick
	basepairs. The starting structure of spinach chloroplast Loop E was
	modeled using isostericity principles, and the simulations refined
	the geometries of the three non-Watson-Crick basepairs that differ
	from the consensus bacterial sequence. The deep groove of Loop E
	motifs provides unique sites for cation binding. Binding of Mg(2+)
	rigidifies Loop E and stabilizes its major groove at an intermediate
	width. In the absence of Mg(2+), the Loop E motifs show an unprecedented
	degree of inner-shell binding of monovalent cations that, in contrast
	to Mg(2+), penetrate into the most negative regions inside the deep
	groove. The spinach chloroplast Loop E shows a marked tendency to
	compress its deep groove compared with the bacterial consensus. Structures
	with a narrow deep groove essentially collapse around a string of
	Na(+) cations with long coordination times. The Loop E non-Watson-Crick
	basepairing is complemented by highly specific hydration sites ranging
	from water bridges to hydration pockets hosting 2 to 3 long-residing
	waters. The ordered hydration is intimately connected with RNA local
	conformational variations.},

	RNA 3D Structures}},
  journal = {Journal of Mathematical Biology},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {215-252},
  abstract = {New methods are described for finding recurrent three-dimensional
	(3D) motifs in RNA atomic-resolution structures. Recurrent RNA 3D
	motifs are sets of RNA nucleotides with similar spatial arrangements.
	They can be local or composite. Local motifs comprise nucleotides
	that occur in the same hairpin or internal loop. Composite motifs
	comprise nucleotides belonging to three or more different RNA strand
	segments or molecules. We use a base-centered approach to construct
	efficient, yet exhaustive search procedures using geometric, symbolic,
	or mixed representations of RNA structure that we implement in a
	suite of MATLAB programs, "Find RNA 3D" (FR3D). The first modules
	of FR3D preprocess structure files to classify base-pair and -stacking
	interactions. Each base is represented geometrically by the position
	of its glycosidic nitrogen in 3D space and by the rotation matrix
	that describes its orientation with respect to a common frame. Base-pairing
	and base-stacking interactions are calculated from the base geometries
	and are represented symbolically according to the Leontis/Westhof
	basepairing classification, extended to include base-stacking. These
	data are stored and used to organize motif searches. For geometric
	searches, the user supplies the 3D structure of a query motif which
	FR3D uses to find and score geometrically similar candidate motifs,
	without regard to the sequential position of their nucleotides in
	the RNA chain or the identity of their bases. To score and rank candidate
	motifs, FR3D calculates a geometric discrepancy by rigidly rotating
	candidates to align optimally with the query motif and then comparing
	the relative orientations of the corresponding bases in the query
	and candidate motifs. Given the growing size of the RNA structure
	database, it is impossible to explicitly compute the discrepancy
	for all conceivable candidate motifs, even for motifs with less than
	ten nucleotides. The screening algorithm that we describe finds all
	candidate motifs whose geometric discrepancy with respect to the
	query motif falls below a user-specified cutoff discrepancy. This
	technique can be applied to RMSD searches. Candidate motifs identified
	geometrically may be further screened symbolically to identify those
	that contain particular basepair types or base-stacking arrangements
	or that conform to sequence continuity or nucleotide identity constraints.
	Purely symbolic searches for motifs containing user-defined sequence,
	continuity and interaction constraints have also been implemented.
	We demonstrate that FR3D finds all occurrences, both local and composite
	and with nucleotide substitutions, of sarcin/ricin and kink-turn
	motifs in the 23S and 5S ribosomal RNA 3D structures of the H. marismortui
	50S ribosomal subunit and assigns the lowest discrepancy scores to
	bona fide examples of these motifs. The search algorithms have been
	optimized for speed to allow users to search the non-redundant RNA
	3D structure database on a personal computer in a matter of minutes.},

  abstract = {Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried

	of the overall dynamics, base pairing, hydration, cation binding
	and other SRD features is presented. The SRD is surprisingly static
	in multiple 25 ns long simulations and lacks any non-local motions,
	with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values between averaged
	MD and high-resolution X-ray structures of 1-1.4 A. Modest dynamics
	is observed in the tetraloop, namely, rotation of adenine in its
	apex and subtle reversible shift of the tetraloop with respect to
	the adjacent base pair. The deformed flexible region in low-resolution
	rat X-ray structure is repaired by simulations. The simulations reveal
	few backbone flips, which do not affect positions of bases and do
	not indicate a force field imbalance. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs
	are rigid and mediated by long-residency water molecules while there
	are several modest cation-binding sites around SRD. In summary, SRD

	We find that Na+ and Mg2+ play distinctive roles in helixï¿½helix
	assembly. High [Na+] (>0.3 M) causes a reduced helixï¿½helix electrostatic
	repulsion and a subsequent disordered packing of helices. In contrast,
	Mg2+ of concentration >1 mM is predicted to induce helixï¿½helix
	attraction and results in a more compact and ordered helixï¿½helix
	packing. Mg2+ is much more efficient in causing nucleic acid compaction.
	In addition, the free energy landscape shows that the tethering loops
	between the helices also play a significant role. A flexible loop,
	such as a neutral loop or a polynucleotide loop in high salt concentration,
	enhances the close approach of the helices in order to gain the loop
	entropy. On the other hand, a rigid loop, such as a polynucleotide
	loop in low salt concentration, tends to de-compact the helices.
	Therefore, a polynucleotide loop significantly enhances the sharpness
	of the ion-induced compaction transition. Moreover, we find that
	a larger number of helices in the system or a smaller radius of the
	divalent ions can cause a more abrupt compaction transition and a
	more compact state at high ion concentration, and the ion size effect
	becomes more pronounced as the number of helices is increased.},

	n (C4'n-1, Pn, C4'n, Pn+1) and t (Pn, C4'n, Pn+1, C4'n+1), which can

	find that major clusters in the nablaï¿½theta plot are few, underscoring
	the discrete

  abstract = {G.U wobble base pairs are the most common and highly conserved non-Watson-Crick
	base pairs in RNA. Previous surface maps imply uniformly negative
	electrostatic potential at the major groove of G.U wobble base pairs
	embedded in RNA helices, suitable for entrapment of cationic ligands.
	In this work, we have used a Poisson-Boltzmann approach to gain a
	more detailed and accurate characterization of the electrostatic
	profile. We found that the major groove edge of an isolated G.U wobble
	displays distinctly enhanced negativity compared with standard GC
	or AU base pairs; however, in the context of different helical motifs,
	the electrostatic pattern varies. G.U wobbles with distinct widening
	have similar major groove electrostatic potentials to their canonical
	counterparts, whereas those with minimal widening exhibit significantly
	enhanced electronegativity, ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 kT/e, depending
	upon structural features. We propose that the negativity at the major
	groove of G.U wobble base pairs is determined by the combined effect
	of the base atoms and the sugar-phosphate backbone, which is impacted
	by stacking pattern and groove width as a result of base sequence.
	These findings are significant in that they provide predictive power

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recent discoveries of large numbers of non-coding
	RNAs and computational advances in genome-scale RNA search create
	a need for tools for automatic, high quality identification and characterization
	of conserved RNA motifs that can be readily used for database search.
	Previous tools fall short of this goal. RESULTS: CMfinder is a new
	tool to predict RNA motifs in unaligned sequences. It is an expectation
	maximization algorithm using covariance models for motif description,
	featuring novel integration of multiple techniques for effective
	search of motif space, and a Bayesian framework that blends mutual
	information-based and folding energy-based approaches to predict
	structure in a principled way. Extensive tests show that our method
	works well on datasets with either low or high sequence similarity,
	is robust to inclusion of lengthy extraneous flanking sequence and/or
	completely unrelated sequences, and is reasonably fast and scalable.
	In testing on 19 known ncRNA families, including some difficult cases
	with poor sequence conservation and large indels, our method demonstrates
	excellent average per-base-pair accuracy--79\% compared with at most
	60\% for alternative methods. More importantly, the resulting probabilistic
	model can be directly used for homology search, allowing iterative
	refinement of structural models based on additional homologs. We
	have used this approach to obtain highly accurate covariance models
	of known RNA motifs based on small numbers of related sequences,
	which identified homologs in deeply-diverged species.},

	representation of DNA and with more realistic models that take account
	of the precise deformability of the constituent base-pair steps.
	Notably, the variance of end-to-end distance shows a quadratic increase
	with chain length in short chains of both types. We also consider
	the contributions to chain extension from the chemical linkages used
	to attach small molecular probes to DNA. The distribution of computed
	distances is sensitive to the intrinsic structure and allowed deformations
	of the tether. Surprisingly, the enhancement in end-to-end variance
	associated with the presence of the probe depends upon chain length,
	even when the probe is rigidly connected to DNA. We find that the
	elastic rod model of DNA in combination with a slightly fluctuating
	tether accounts satisfactorily for the distributions of end-to-end
	distances extracted from the small-angle X-ray scattering of gold
	nanocrystals covalently linked to the ends of short DNAs. There is
	no need to introduce additional structural fluctuations to reproduce
	the measured uptake in end-to-end fluctuations with chain length.},
