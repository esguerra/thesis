The problem of classification of the space of conformations
%configurations?
of RNA  is not  new, see for  example, Olson  1972 \cite{olson1_1972},
Saenger     1984     \cite{saenger1984},     and    Gautheret     1993
\cite{gautheret1993}.  This  problem had only been addressed  by a few
researchers before the turn of  the twenty first century, but starting
in  the year  2000 a  vast amount  of RNA  structural  information has
become  available with  the elucidation  of the  structure of  the 30S
small ribosomal subunit  of \textit{Thermus thermophilus}, a bacterial
ribosome \cite{wimberly2000, schluenzen2000}, and the 50S large
ribosomal subunit of \textit{Haloarcula marismortui}, an archaeal
%\footnote{I emphasize the  phylogeny of rRNA's here since  there is an
%  ongoing discussion among biologists on whether archaea are closer to
%  prokaryotes, or to eukaryotes.}
ribosome \cite{ban2000}.

20010.}
\label{fig:rnainpdb}
\end{figure}

\noindent Between  1978 and  2000 a total  of 116 RNA  structures with
resolution greater than 3.5\AA,  and comprising around 5500 nucleotide
bases are found  in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),  and between 2000 and
today  a  total of  931  RNA\index{RNA}  structures comprising  around
570000  nucleotide  bases  are   found.   That  is,  the  increase  in
information due to the solution  of large RNA structures is two orders
of   magnitude  as   pointed  out   by  Noller   \cite{noller2005}  in
2005. Looking  at the growth  of RNA structural information  from 2000
until  today it's  important to  point  out that,  although the  total
number of RNA structures deposited in the PDB shows exponential growth
(see left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:rnainpdb}), the total number of RNA
bases does  not show  such a  well defined trend  (see right  panel in
Figure~\ref{fig:rnainpdb}).  This is due  to the size preponderance of
ribosomal structures.  That is,  in 2005 nineteen ribosomal structures
were deposited in  the PDB, whereas in 2006  only four were deposited.
So, even  though interest in RNA  seems to be  growing since ribosomal
structures have  become available in  2000, and two Nobel  prizes were
awarded for work in RNA in 2006, along with the exciting possibilities
of  deciphering even larger  RNA virus\index{virus}  structures, still
the growth of the RNA structural field is far from that of proteins if
weighed by the growth of  RNA structural information in the past seven
years. This fact is due to the smaller sizes and structural
diversity   of   RNA   molecules crystallized to this date,   which,   as
can   be   seen   in
Figure~\ref{fig:rnaranges},  is restricted  to  ``compact'' nucleotide
ranges\index{RNA!ranges}.
%\footnote{One can
% also think of another range of even larger viral RNA's \cite{heitsh}, and yet
%another one of nanodesgined RNA's \cite{shapiro, orland}}. 
A representative example of these  characteristic ranges can be seen in
Table 1.1 for structures larger than 300 bases.

\end{figure}
%The table and Figure 1.1 come from downloading all structures from
%2000, until today that have RNA in the pdb and that have a resolution
%better that 3.0A, they are 460 structures.

\noindent The analysis of RNA conformational information contained in RNA
structural data can  be divided into three main  perspectives: an atom
based perspective; a bond  based perspective; and a third, as yet unexplored
to our knowledge,  rigid-body based perspective.   In the atom based
perspective,  either direct  comparison of  backbone atom  positions is
made \cite{reijmers2001}, or a comparison of distances between a reduced
set  of atoms  taken from  the  nucleotide backbone,  sugar, and  base
\cite{sykes2005}. The bond based  perspective is divided into three main
categories; the first considers the consecutive covalent bonds in the RNA
backbone and the glycosidic bond between the sugar and base,  that is, six
backbone   torsion   angles   and   one   glycosidic   torsion   angle
\cite{reijmers2001,  murray2003, hershkovitz2003, schneider2004,
hershkovitz2006};
or alternatively the pseudo-bonds between consecutive
P and  C4$\prime$ atoms  and the resulting  pseudo-torsion angles  $\eta$ and
$\theta$  \cite{olson1_1972,  duarte1998,  duarte2003, wadley2007}.  The
third category considers the  networks of horizontal hydrogen bonding
patterns coming  from a definition  of interacting edge  boundaries in
the nucleotide bases  \cite{westhof2000, leontis2002, leontis2006}. In
this chapter we study the rigid body based perspective using
clustering analysis.

\section{Consensus Clustering of Single Stranded Base Step Parameters}
To our  knowledge there has  been no classification of rigid-body
base-step  parameters for RNA structures deposited at  the
PDB. It is important
to note here that in  crystal structures, RNA bases are determined more
accurately  than  backbone  torsion  angles,  as  has  been  shown  by
Richardson  and collaborators from  analysis of  van der  Waals steric
clashes.   This can  be seen  more clearly  in Figure~\ref{fig:murray},
reproduced from Richardson's work \cite{murray2003}, where the red
and orange dots  in the backbone atoms region  denote steric clashes and
the green  and yellow  dots in  the base atoms  region denote  very good
agreement with expected van der Waals distances.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 the  blue and  green dots  in  a) mean  very accurate  van der  Waals
 distances, and  in b)  the red and  orange dots mean  steric clashes,
 that is, distances outside the acceptable van der Waals range.}

\subsection{Combining Fourier Averaging Results and Clustering Analysis}
Using the coordinates files of 20 rRNA structures provided by 
Schneider at al.\cite{schneider2004}  we have
used standard clustering analysis (CA) techniques to classify a set of
non-ARNA base-steps  using, rather than the torsion  angles space, the
base-step  parameters space, that  is, three  translational parameters
(Shift$D_x$, Slide$D_y$,  Rise$D_z$), and three  rotational parameters
(Tilt$\tau$,  Roll$\rho$, Twist$\omega$), which  are described  by the
hexaparametric vector $\nu$:

\begin{gather}
 \nu = (D_x, D_y, D_z, \tau, \rho, \omega)
\end{gather}

The     results      illustrated     in     Figures~\ref{fig:eucl_cons}
and~\ref{fig:nonAclus} were  obtained   by   performing  clustering
analysis  and  consensus  clustering  on  20  structures  provided  by
Schneider et  al.  \cite{schneider2004}. These  twenty structures were
obtained  by  Schneider applying  a  Fourier  averaging technique,  and
lexicographical  clustering,  to  torsion  angles  of  23S  rRNA.   The
methodology  we  used follows  that  used  by  others to  recover  the
periodic table  classification from multidimensional  property vectors
for  elements \cite{restrepo2004,  restrepo2006}. Table~\ref{tab:nonA}
shows the residue  numbers of bases from 23S rRNA  which belong to the
main  categories   of  Figure~\ref{fig:nonAclus}.   To   decide  which
residues of  23S rRNA belonged to  the non-Atype clusters,  a root mean
squared  deviation (RMSD) of  15  or  less  was required  between  step
parameter vectors of  23S rRNA and the mean  parameter vectors for the 
four non-Atype groups identified.

\subsection{Partitional Clustering for Rigid Body Parameters}

The same type of analysis that has been carried out for torsion angles
can  also  be  carried  out   for  rigid  body  parameters,  that  is,
partitional  clustering, and  hierarchical  clustering, are used  as 
standard statistical  analysis methods  to analyze  our set  of  2753 
base-step parameter vectors.  For the  partitional clustering case, 
again, there is no known number of clusters in which the data must
group, therefore we've  calculated the  within clusters  sum  of
squares and also  the
average silhouette widths, for a particular selection of the number of
partitions of the data for $k=[2-80]$.  From figure~\ref{fig:wssSteps}
we can't conclude  much. We see that the value  of the within clusters
sum  of squares  becomes constant  around  $k=47$ and  there´s also  a
change of  curvature around  $k=13$.  For the  case where  the average
silhoutte width has been computed, that is, figure~\ref{fig:aswSteps},
we see that  the maximum is for $k=2$, and  there are some interesting
maxima at  $k=9,12$.  Now that  we have a  clue as to which  number of
partitions the data  optimally has we have plotted  the k-means results
for $k=13$ and $k=47$ in Figures  bla and bla, and the PAM results for
$k=2, 9, 12$ in Figure bla.

We have  also prefiltered  the data according  to the 16  possible RNA
base steps, that is,  AA, AG, GA, GG, UU, UC, CU,  CC, UA, UG, CA, CG,
AU, AC,  GU, and  GC.  Tables showing  how many  representatives steps
there are  belonging to  non-helical, helical, and  watson-crick sets,
will be later included and discussed here.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Hierarchical Clustering for Rigid Body Parameters}

Also as has been carried out for torsion angles, hierarchical clustering has
also been performed on rigid body parameters, the results are yet to be
included here. A cluster dissimilarity tree can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:clusdis} for the 12 trees resulting from the four clustering
methods and three distance definitions used to cluster the base step data.

\section{RNA Conformations}
There are two main RNA conformations, A-RNA ,and A'RNA, and maybe even a
third unconfirmed one A"RNA \cite{saenger1984}.
Their values for their standard torsion angles and step parameters can be seen
in Tables~\ref{tab:tor_conf} and ~\ref{tab:step_conf}
