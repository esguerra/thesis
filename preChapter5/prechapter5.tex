\section{Introduction}
The  ruling  perspective  in  RNA  reconstruction  and  conformational
searches without  a doubt  is the backbone  based, and  then following
closely, an atom based, or atom coarse-grained view.  We want to use a
different  perspective,  that which  comes  from  a more  ``mechanical
engineering''   set    of   mind,   that    is,   the   calladine-drew
\cite{elhassan1995}  take  on nucleic-acids  geometry,  or the  helical
perspective. 3DNA  is the ideal tool  for this work  since it computes
pair  and  step parameters,  and  helical  parameters.  In short  here
follows a table with the parameters given by 3DNA and what they are:


\begin{equation}
    \label{simple_equation}
    \alpha = \sqrt{ \beta }
\end{equation}
